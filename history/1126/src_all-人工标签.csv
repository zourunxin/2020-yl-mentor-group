a number of significant features and is now developed independently.
This package contains example source files distributed with boost.
Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.  The
emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
Library, in the hopes of establishing ""existing practice"" for
extensions and providing reference implementations so that the Boost
libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. (Some of the
libraries have already been included in the C++ 2011 standard and
others have been proposed to the C++ Standards Committee for inclusion
in future standards.)
Run-time support for Boost.Coroutine, a library that provides
generalized subroutines which allow multiple entry points for
suspending and resuming execution.

Run-time support for the Parallel BGL graph library.  The interface and
graph components are generic, in the same sense as the Standard
Template Library (STL).  This libraries in this package use MPICH
back-end to do the parallel work.

Run-time support for the Boost Fiber library, a framework for
micro-/userland-threads (fibers) scheduled cooperatively.

Python 3 support for Boost.MPI-OpenMPI, a library providing a clean C++
API over the OpenMPI implementation of MPI.

Run-time support for the Boost.Wave library, a Standards conforming,
and highly configurable implementation of the mandated C99/C++
preprocessor functionality.

Run-time support for Boost.Locale, a set of localization and Unicode
handling tools.

Run-time support for the BGL graph library.  BGL interface and graph
components are generic, in the same sense as the Standard Template
Library (STL).

The Boost Python Library is a framework for interfacing Python and
C++. It allows you to quickly and seamlessly expose C++ classes,
functions and objects to Python, and vice versa, using no special
tools -- just your C++ compiler.  This package contains run-time
support for the NumPy extension of the Boost Python Library for Python 3.

Run-time component of the Boost stacktrace library.

Run-time component Boost.Thread library, which provides classes and
functions for managing multiple threads of execution, and for
synchronizing data between the threads or providing separate copies of
data specific to individual threads.

Run-time support for Boost.MPI-MPICH, a library providing a clean C++
API over the MPICH implementation of MPI.

Run-time support for C99 and C++ TR1 C-style Functions from the math
portion of Boost.TR1.

Run-time support for the Parallel BGL graph library.  The interface and
graph components are generic, in the same sense as the Standard
Template Library (STL).  This libraries in this package use OpenMPI
back-end to do the parallel work.

Run-time support of boost program options library, which allows program
developers to obtain (name, value) pairs from the user, via
conventional methods such as command-line and configuration file.

Run-time support for Boost.Iostreams, a framework for defining streams,
stream buffers and i/o filters.

Run-time support for Boost Date Time, a set of date-time libraries based
on generic programming concepts.

Boost.Container library implements several well-known containers,
including STL containers. The aim of the library is to offer advanced
features not present in standard containers or to offer the latest
standard draft features for compilers that comply with C++03.
Static Boost C++ libraries.

The Boost Python Library is a framework for interfacing Python and
C++. It allows you to quickly and seamlessly expose C++ classes,
functions and objects to Python, and vice versa, using no special
tools -- just your C++ compiler.  This package contains run-time
support for the Boost Python Library compiled for Python 3.

The Boost.TypeErasure library provides runtime polymorphism in C++
that is more flexible than that provided by the core language.

Run-time support for serialization for persistence and marshaling.

Run-time support for managed signals & slots callback implementation.

""How long does my C++ code take to run?""
The Boost Timer library answers that question and does so portably,
with as little as one #include and one additional line of code.

Run-time support for Boost.Atomic, a library that provides atomic data
types and operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering
constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
variables.

Python 3 support for Boost.MPI-MPICH, a library providing a clean C++
API over the MPICH implementation of MPI.

Run-time support for boost random library.

Run-time support for Boost.MPI-OpenMPI, a library providing a clean C++
API over the OpenMPI implementation of MPI.

Run-time support for the Boost Filesystem Library, which provides
portable facilities to query and manipulate paths, files, and
directories.

Run-time support for Boost.Chrono, a set of useful time utilities.

Run-time support for Boost.Context, a foundational library that
provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread.

Run-time support for boost regular expression library.

Boost.Log library aims to make logging significantly easier for the
application developer.  It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box
tools along with public interfaces for extending the library.
Boost.Build is an easy way to build C++ projects, everywhere. You name
your pieces of executable and libraries and list their sources.  Boost.Build
takes care about compiling your sources with the right options,
creating static and shared libraries, making pieces of executable, and other
chores -- whether you're using GCC, MSVC, or a dozen more supported
C++ compilers -- on Windows, OSX, Linux and commercial UNIX systems.

BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with
object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell
executes standard Java statements and expressions, in addition to
obvious scripting commands and syntax. BeanShell supports scripted
objects as simple method closures like those in Perl and
JavaScript(tm). You can use BeanShell interactively for Java
experimentation and debugging or as a simple scripting engine for your
applications. In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted Java,
plus some useful stuff. Another way to describe it is to say that in
many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is
embeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications to
execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting
extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you can call your
Java applications and objects from BeanShell; working with Java
objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in Java and
runs in the same space as your application, you can freely pass
references to ""real live"" objects into scripts and return them as
results.

applications. In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted Java,
plus some useful stuff. Another way to describe it is to say that in
many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is
embeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications to
execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting
extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you can call your
Java applications and objects from BeanShell; working with Java
objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in Java and
runs in the same space as your application, you can freely pass
references to ""real live"" objects into scripts and return them as
results.",Lightweight Scripting for Java,"bsh-javadoc

As well aiming for a nice API, we think having a single library as opposed
to an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being
able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility
APIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented
once and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.

cyrus-imapd-3.0.7-23.an8.src.rpm,,,"vzic is a program to convert the Olson timezone database files into VTIMEZONE
files compatible with the iCalendar specification (RFC2445).

This package contains a forked version of vzic for internal use by the Cyrus
IMAP server.
The Cyrus IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server provides access to
personal mail, system-wide bulletin boards, news-feeds, calendar and contacts
through the IMAP, JMAP, NNTP, CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The Cyrus IMAP
server is a scalable enterprise groupware system designed for use from small to
large enterprise environments using technologies based on well-established Open
Standards.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on sealed nodes, where users are not
normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the
filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail
is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, JMAP, POP3, POP3S, KPOP, CalDAV
and/or CardDAV protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.
The cyrus-imapd-utils package contains administrative tools for the

distributing scanned documents, digital documents, or high-resolution pictures.
DjVu content downloads faster, displays and renders faster, looks nicer on a
screen, and consume less client resources than competing formats. DjVu images
display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed and panned with no lengthy
re-rendering.

DjVuLibre is a free (GPL'ed) implementation of DjVu, including viewers,
decoders, simple encoders, and utilities. The browser plugin is in its own

Dyninst is an Application Program Interface (API) to permit the insertion of
code into a running program. The API also permits changing or removing
subroutine calls from the application program. Run-time code changes are
useful to support a variety of applications including debugging, performance
monitoring, and to support composing applications out of existing packages.
The goal of this API is to provide a machine independent interface to permit
the creation of tools and applications that use run-time code patching.

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling

with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and

hivex-1.3.18-23.module+an8.6.0+10755+cbf458a5.src.rpm,,,"ocaml-hivex contains OCaml bindings for hivex.

This is for toplevel and scripting access only.  To compile OCaml
programs which use hivex you will also need ocaml-hivex-devel.
perl-hivex contains Perl bindings for hivex.
Hive files are the undocumented binary files that Windows uses to
store the Windows Registry on disk.  Hivex is a library that can read
and write to these files.

'hivexsh' is a shell you can use to interactively navigate a hive
binary file.

'hivexregedit' (in perl-hivex) lets you export and merge to the
textual regedit format.

'hivexml' can be used to convert a hive file to a more useful XML
format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.

For OCaml bindings, see 'ocaml-hivex-devel'.

For Perl bindings, see 'perl-hivex'.

For Python 3 bindings, see 'python3-hivex'.

compatibility of a set of approved symbols, however it is heavily modified with
backports and fixes pulled from newer upstream Linux kernel releases. This means
this is not a 4.18.0 kernel anymore: it includes several components which come
from newer upstream linux versions, while maintaining a well tested and stable
core. Some of the components/backports that may be pulled in are: changes like
updates to the core kernel (eg.: scheduler, cgroups, memory management, security
fixes and features), updates to block layer, supported filesystems, major driver
updates for supported hardware in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, enhancements for
enterprise customers, etc.

lato-fonts-2.015-5.0.1.an8.src.rpm,,,"Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
designer _ukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says _ukasz.

Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics.

and downloading files and directories to and from virtual machines.

Virt-customize is a command line tool for customizing virtual machine
disk images.

Virt-df is a command line tool to display free space on virtual
machine filesystems.  Unlike other tools, it doesn__ just display the
amount of space allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside
the virtual machine to see how much space is really being used.  It is
like the df(1) command, but for virtual machines, except that it also
works for Windows virtual machines.

Virt-diff shows the differences between virtual machines.

Virt-edit is a command line tool to edit the contents of a file in a
virtual machine.

Virt-filesystems is a command line tool to display the filesystems,
partitions, block devices, LVs, VGs and PVs found in a disk image
or virtual machine.  It replaces the deprecated programs
virt-list-filesystems and virt-list-partitions with a much more
capable tool.

Virt-format is a command line tool to erase and make blank disks.

Virt-get-kernel extracts a kernel/initrd from a disk image.

Virt-inspector examines a virtual machine and tries to determine the
version of the OS, the kernel version, what drivers are installed,
whether the virtual machine is fully virtualized (FV) or
para-virtualized (PV), what applications are installed and more.

Virt-log is a command line tool to display the log files from a
virtual machine.

Virt-ls is a command line tool to list out files in a virtual machine.

Virt-make-fs is a command line tool to build a filesystem out of
a collection of files or a tarball.

Virt-rescue provides a rescue shell for making interactive,
unstructured fixes to virtual machines.

Virt-resize can resize existing virtual machine disk images.

Virt-sparsify makes virtual machine disk images sparse (thin-provisioned).

Virt-sysprep lets you reset or unconfigure virtual machines in
preparation for cloning them.

Virt-tail follows (tails) a log file within a guest, like 'tail -f'.

Virt-tar-in and virt-tar-out are archive, backup and upload tools
for virtual machines.  These replace the deprecated program virt-tar.

Virt-win-reg lets you look at and modify the Windows Registry of
Windows virtual machines.

this package).  This package is only used directly when you want
to avoid dependencies on Perl.
libguestfs-inspect-icons is a metapackage that pulls in additional
dependencies required by libguestfs to pull icons out of non-Linux
guests.  Install this package if you want libguestfs to be able to
inspect non-Linux guests and display icons from them.

The only reason this is a separate package is to avoid core libguestfs
having to depend on Perl.  See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1194158

Libguestfs is a library for accessing and modifying virtual machine
disk images.  http://libguestfs.org

It can be used to make batch configuration changes to guests, get
disk used/free statistics (virt-df), migrate between hypervisors
(virt-p2v, virt-v2v), perform backups and guest clones, change
registry/UUID/hostname info, build guests from scratch (virt-builder)
and much more.

Libguestfs uses Linux kernel and qemu code, and can access any type of
guest filesystem that Linux and qemu can, including but not limited
to: ext2/3/4, FAT and NTFS, LVM, many different disk partition
schemes, qcow, qcow2, vmdk.

libxcrypt-4.1.1-6.0.3.an8.src.rpm,,,"This package contains the libxcrypt static libraries for -static
linking.  You don't need this, unless you link statically, which
is highly discouraged.
libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based password
hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt.

its task by building up a conventional Maven command line from options given in

NetworkManager-1.36.0-7.0.1.an8_6.src.rpm,,,"This adds a curses-based ""TUI"" (Text User Interface) to
NetworkManager, to allow performing some of the operations supported
by nm-connection-editor and nm-applet in a non-graphical environment.

This package contains NetworkManager support for Open vSwitch bridges.
This package contains NetworkManager support for PPP.
This adds a NetworkManager configuration file to make it behave more
like the old ""network"" service. In particular, it stops NetworkManager
from automatically running DHCP on unconfigured ethernet devices, and
allows connections with static IP addresses to be brought up even on
ethernet devices with no carrier.

This package is intended to be installed by default for server
deployments.
This adds a NetworkManager dispatcher file to support networking
configurations using ""/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-NAME"" files
(eg, to do policy-based routing).

Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways.

reference to a scalar it is used as the filename to open for ouput. Any other
reference is used as the filehandle to write to. Otherwise output defaults to

Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting.  Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.

Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your system to
handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter.

If your script requires some Perl modules, you can install them with
""perl(MODULE)"" where ""MODULE"" is a name of required module. E.g. install
""perl(Test::More)"" to make Test::More Perl module available.

called core modules, install perl-core package.

If you only need perl run-time as a shared library, i.e. Perl interpreter
embedded into another application, the only essential package is perl-libs.

Perl header files can be found in perl-devel package.

Perl utils like ""splain"" or ""perlbug"" can be found in perl-utils package.
This module is a simple wrapper around Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, designed
to alleviate the need of creating Language Classes for module authors.
This modules provides an IO:: style interface to the Compress::Zlib package.
The main advantage is that you can use an IO::Zlib object in much the same way
as an IO::File object so you can have common code that doesn't know which sort
of file it is using.
This is a dummy package to improve a compatibility with future Perls that will use
this package to deliver /usr/bin/perl Perl interpreter.
The libnetcfg utility can be used to configure the libnet.
This package converts files from POD format (see perlpod) to HTML format. It
can automatically generate indexes and cross-references, and it keeps a cache
of things it knows how to cross-reference.
Devel::SelfStubber prints the stubs you need to put in the module before the
__DATA__ token (or you can get it to print the entire module with stubs
correctly placed). The stubs ensure that if a method is called, it will get
loaded. They are needed specifically for inherited autoloaded methods.
The ""open"" pragma serves as one of the interfaces to declare default ""layers""
(also known as ""disciplines"") for all I/O.
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided by
external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these external
modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by perl, this module
offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded and/or unloaded.

This Perl module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's class to
define attribute handler subroutines for specific attributes. Variables and
subroutines subsequently defined in that package, or in packages derived from
that package may be given attributes with the same names as the attribute
handler subroutines, which will then be called in one of the compilation
phases (i.e. in a ""BEGIN"", ""CHECK"", ""INIT"", or ""END"" block).
Devel::Peek contains functions which allows raw Perl datatypes to be
manipulated from a Perl script. This is used by those who do XS programming to
check that the data they are sending from C to Perl looks as they think it
should look.
Memoizing a function makes it faster by trading space for time. It does
this by caching the return values of the function in a table. If you call
the function again with the same arguments, memoize jumps in and gives
you the value out of the table, instead of letting the function compute
the value all over again.
""Errno"" defines and conditionally exports all the error constants defined in
your system ""errno.h"" include file. It has a single export tag, "":POSIX"",
which will export all POSIX defined error numbers.
This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By default, Perl
limits itself to real numbers, but an extra ""use"" statement brings full
complex support, along with a full set of mathematical functions typically
associated with and/or extended to complex numbers.

that package may be given attributes with the same names as the attribute
handler subroutines, which will then be called in one of the compilation
phases (i.e. in a ""BEGIN"", ""CHECK"", ""INIT"", or ""END"" block).
Memoizing a function makes it faster by trading space for time. It does
this by caching the return values of the function in a table. If you call
the function again with the same arguments, memoize jumps in and gives
you the value out of the table, instead of letting the function compute
the value all over again.
""Errno"" defines and conditionally exports all the error constants defined in
your system ""errno.h"" include file. It has a single export tag, "":POSIX"",
which will export all POSIX defined error numbers.
This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By default, Perl
limits itself to real numbers, but an extra ""use"" statement brings full
complex support, along with a full set of mathematical functions typically
associated with and/or extended to complex numbers.

Perl header files can be found in perl-devel package.

Perl utils like ""splain"" or ""perlbug"" can be found in perl-utils package.
This Perl module tells its users that functions in a package are to be
autoloaded from after the ""__DATA__"" token. See also ""Autoloading"" in
perlsub.
Net::Ping module contains methods to test the reachability of remote hosts on
a network.
writemain() takes an argument list of directories containing archive libraries
that relate to perl modules and should be linked into a new perl binary. It
writes a corresponding perlmain.c file that is a plain C file containing all
the bootstrap code to make the If the first argument to writemain() is a
reference to a scalar it is used as the file name to open for output. Any other
reference is used as the file handle to write to. Otherwise output defaults to
STDOUT.
The Time::Piece module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions
with implementations that return objects.  It does so in a backwards compatible
manner, so that using localtime or gmtime as documented in perlfunc still
behave as expected.
The is a perl run-time (interpreter as a shared library and include
directories).
This module is a simple wrapper around Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, designed
to alleviate the need of creating Language Classes for module authors.
This modules provides an IO:: style interface to the Compress::Zlib package.
The main advantage is that you can use an IO::Zlib object in much the same way
as an IO::File object so you can have common code that doesn't know which sort
of file it is using.
The libnetcfg utility can be used to configure the libnet.
This package converts files from POD format (see perlpod) to HTML format. It
can automatically generate indexes and cross-references, and it keeps a cache
of things it knows how to cross-reference.
Several utilities which come with Perl distribution like h2ph, perlbug,
perlthanks, pl2pm, and splain. Some utilities are provided by more specific
packages like perldoc by perl-Pod-Perldoc.
Devel::SelfStubber prints the stubs you need to put in the module before the
__DATA__ token (or you can get it to print the entire module with stubs
correctly placed). The stubs ensure that if a method is called, it will get
loaded. They are needed specifically for inherited autoloaded methods.

The ""open"" pragma serves as one of the interfaces to declare default ""layers""
(also known as ""disciplines"") for all I/O.
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided by
external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these external
modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by perl, this module
offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded and/or unloaded.
RPM macros that are handy when building binary RPM packages.
This Perl module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's class to

automatically closes and re-opens files if you exceed your system
maximum number of file descriptors, or the suggested maximum.
Fcntl module provides file operation related options.
The Benchmark module encapsulates a number of routines to help you figure out

""base"" module allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up
inheritance from those modules at the same time.  Unless you are using the
""fields"" pragma, consider this module discouraged in favor of the
lighter-weight ""parent"".
ODBM_File establishes a connection between a Perl hash variable and a file in
odbm format. You can manipulate the data in the file just as if it were in
a Perl hash, but when your program exits, the data will remain in the file, to
be used the next time your program runs.
Devel::SelfStubber prints the stubs you need to put in the module before the
__DATA__ token (or you can get it to print the entire module with stubs
correctly placed). The stubs ensure that if a method is called, it will get
loaded. They are needed specifically for inherited autoloaded methods.
This module provides you with objects that will collate according to your
national character set. This module is deprecated. See the perllocale manual
page for further information.
Split up your program into files that the AutoLoader module can handle. It is
used by both the standard Perl libraries and by the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
utility, to automatically configure libraries for automatic loading.
Several utilities which come with Perl distribution like h2ph, perlbug,
perlthanks, and pl2pm. Some utilities are provided by more specific
packages like perldoc by perl-Pod-Perldoc and splain by perl-diagnostics.
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide

external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these external
modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by perl, this module
offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded and/or unloaded.
The AutoLoader module works with the AutoSplit module and the ""__END__"" token
to defer the loading of some subroutines until they are used rather than
loading them all at once.
Overloading pragma allows you to lexically disable or enable overloading.
It stores all unambiguous truncations of each element of a list as keys in
an associative array. The values are the original list elements.
This module provides aliases for the built-in variables whose names no one
seems to like to read.
This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By default, Perl
limits itself to real numbers, but an extra ""use"" statement brings full
complex support, along with a full set of mathematical functions typically
associated with and/or extended to complex numbers.
The Getopt::Std module provides functions for processing single-character
switches with switch clustering. Pass one argument which is a string
containing all switches to be recognized.
""deprecate"" pragma simplifies the maintenance of dual-life modules that will no
longer be included in the Perl core in a future Perl release, but are
still included currently. The purpose of the pragma is to alert users to the
status of such a module by issuing a warning that encourages them to install
the module from CPAN, so that a future upgrade to a perl which omits the
module will not break their code.
A File::Compare Perl module provides functions for comparing a content of two
files specified by a file name or a file handle.
The ""if"" module is used to conditionally load another module.
This module provides the ability to use references as hash keys if you first
""tie"" the hash variable to this module. Normally, only the keys of the tied
hash itself are preserved as references; to use references as keys in
hashes-of-hashes, use Tie::RefHash::Nestable, included as part of
Tie::RefHash.
This module provides an interface that allows filters to be applied to tied
hashes associated with DBM files.
Net::Ping module contains methods to test the reachability of remote hosts on
a network.
The POSIX module permits you to access all (or nearly all) the standard POSIX
1003.1 identifiers. Many of these identifiers have been given Perl interfaces.
ExtUtils::Constant facilitates generating C and XS wrapper code to allow
Perl modules to AUTOLOAD constants defined in C library header files.
This is an object-oriented interface for opening files and performing
input/output operations on them.
The is a perl run-time (interpreter as a shared library and include
directories).
This will predeclare all the subroutines whose names are in the list,
allowing you to use them without parentheses (as list operators) even
before they're declared.
The ""overload"" pragma allows overloading of Perl operators for a class. To
overload built-in functions, see ""Overriding Built-in Functions"" in perlsub
POD instead.
There is no reason to use this module nowadays. The DirHandle module provides
an alternative interface to the opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), and
rewinddir() functions. Since Perl 5.6, opendir() alone has been all you need
for lexical handles.
Class::Struct module exports a single function struct(). Given a list of
element names and types, and optionally a class name, struct() creates a
Perl 5 class that implements a struct-like data structure.
The Symbol module provides functions for manipulating Perl symbols.
This Perl module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's class to
define attribute handler subroutines for specific attributes. Variables and
subroutines subsequently defined in that package, or in packages derived from
that package may be given attributes with the same names as the attribute
handler subroutines, which will then be called in one of the compilation
phases (i.e. in a ""BEGIN"", ""CHECK"", ""INIT"", or ""END"" block).
The langinfo() function queries various locale information that can be used to
localize output and user interfaces. It uses the current underlying locale,
regardless of whether or not it was called from within the scope of ""use
locale"".
This pragma tells the compiler to enable (or disable) the use of POSIX locales
for built-in operations (for example, LC_CTYPE for regular expressions,
LC_COLLATE for string comparison, and LC_NUMERIC for number formatting). Each
""use locale"" or ""no locale"" affects statements to the end of the enclosing
block.
This module looks for MakeMaker-like ""blib"" directory structure starting in
given or current directory and working back up to five levels of directories.
It is intended for use on command line with -M option as a way of testing
arbitrary scripts against an uninstalled version of a package.
This module simplifies the manipulation of @INC at compile time.
These are functions that spawn a given command and connects the standard
output of the command for reading, standard output for writing, and standard
error output for handling the errors.
This package provides an object-oriented interface to Perl built-in gmtime()
and localtime () functions.
The NEXT module adds a pseudo-class named ""NEXT"" to any program that uses it.
If a method ""m"" calls ""$self->NEXT::m()"", the call to ""m"" is redispatched as
if the calling method had not originally been found.

These are Perl modules that helps connecting classes with arrays, hashes,
handles, and scalars.
These are functions for searching through directory trees doing work on each
file found similar to the Unix find command.
The Config::Extensions module provides a hash %Extensions containing all the
core extensions that were enabled for this perl.
The Time::Piece module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions
with implementations that return objects.  It does so in a backwards compatible
manner, so that using localtime or gmtime as documented in perlfunc still
behave as expected.
This pragma will predeclare all the variables whose names are in the
list, allowing you to use them under ""use strict"", and disabling any
typo warnings for them.

For use with variables in the current package for a single scope, the
functionality provided by this pragma has been superseded by ""our""
declarations, available in Perl v5.6.0 or later, and use of this pragma is
discouraged.
This package provides an object-oriented interface to Perl build-in getgr*()
and getpw*() functions.
This module overrides the core stat() and lstat() functions, replacing them
with versions that return File::stat objects. This object has methods that
return the similarly named structure field name from the stat(2) function.
This module is a simple wrapper around Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, designed
to alleviate the need of creating Language Classes for module authors.
Language tags are a formalism, described in RFC 3066, for declaring what
language form (language and possibly dialect) a given chunk of information is
in. This library provides functions for common tasks involving language tags
as they are needed in a variety of protocols and applications.
GDBM_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the facilities
provided by the GNU gdbm library.
This package allows a tied hash to load its values automatically on the first
access, and to use the cached value on the following accesses.
NDBM_File establishes a connection between a Perl hash variable and a file in
ndbm format. You can manipulate the data in the file just as if it were in
a Perl hash, but when your program exits, the data will remain in the file, to
be used the next time your program runs.
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.

This is a metapackage with all the Perl bits and core modules that can be
found in the upstream tarball from perl.org.

If you need only a specific feature, you can install a specific package
instead. E.g. to handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter,
install perl-interpreter package. See perl-interpreter description for more
details on the Perl decomposition into packages.
Hash::Util::FieldHash offers a number of functions in support of the
inside-out technique of class construction.
This module sets file position in a file handle to be first line greater than
or equal (string-wise) to a key.
This module enumerates the Perl functions that are documented in perlfunc POD.
RPM macros that are handy when building binary RPM packages.
The ""mro"" name space provides several utilities for dealing with method
resolution order and method caching in general.
It attempts several methods of getting the system hostname and then caches the
result.
Memoizing a function makes it faster by trading space for time. It does
this by caching the return values of the function in a table. If you call
the function again with the same arguments, memoize jumps in and gives
you the value out of the table, instead of letting the function compute
the value all over again.
""Errno"" defines and conditionally exports all the error constants defined in
your system ""errno.h"" include file. It has a single export tag, "":POSIX"",
which will export all POSIX defined error numbers.
""Complete"" routine provides word completion on a list of words in the array.
Dumpvalue module enables you to print a content of variables and other Perl
data structures.
""use less ...;"" is a Perl user-pragma. If you're very lucky some code you're
using will know that you asked for less CPU usage or RAM or fat or... we just
can't know.
This package is just a front end to some other packages. It's a stub to
set up a common interface to the various read-line implementations found
on CPAN (under the ""Term::ReadLine::*"" name space).
With the ""sort"" pragma you can control the behavior of the builtin ""sort()""
function.
This Perl module implements DOS-like globbing with a few enhancements. It
is largely compatible with perlglob.exe in all but one respect--it understands
wild cards in directory components.
These routines allow you to parse file paths into their directory, file name,
and suffix.
This package provide object-oriented interface to Perl built-in gethost*(),
getnet*(), getproto*(), and getserv*() functions.
The Test Perl module simplifies the task of writing test files for Perl modules,
such that their output is in the format that Test::Harness expects to see.
Hash::Util contains special functions for manipulating hashes that don't
really warrant a keyword.
The Unicode::UCD module offers a series of functions that provide a simple
interface to the Unicode Character Database.
The Safe extension module allows the creation of compartments in which Perl
code can be evaluated. Please note that the restriction is not suitable for
security purposes.
A File::Copy module provides two basic functions, copy and move, which are
useful for getting the contents of a file from one place to another.
The libnetcfg utility can be used to configure the libnet.
The diagnostics module extends the terse diagnostics normally emitted by both
the perl compiler and the perl interpreter (from running perl with a -w switch
or ""use warnings""), augmenting them with the more explicative and endearing
descriptions found in perldiag. splain tool explains perl messages found on
standard input.
This package converts files from POD format (see perlpod) to HTML format. It
can automatically generate indexes and cross-references, and it keeps a cache
of things it knows how to cross-reference.
Tie::File represents a regular text file as a Perl array. Each element in the
array corresponds to a record in the file. The first line of the file is
element 0 of the array; the second line is element 1, and so on.  The file is
not loaded into memory, so this will work even for gigantic files.  Changes to
the array are reflected in the file immediately.
Returns a copy of the input string with the nonprintable characters below
0x100 changed into printables. Any ASCII printables or above 0xFF are
unchanged.
The ""B"" module supplies classes which allow a Perl program to delve into its
own innards. It is the module used to implement the backends of the Perl
compiler.
Locates the full path to the script bin directory to allow the use of paths
relative to the bin directory.
The ""open"" pragma serves as one of the interfaces to declare default ""layers""
(also known as ""disciplines"") for all I/O.
The default behavior of file test operators (e.g. ""-r"") is to use the simple
mode bits as returned by the stat() family of system calls. However, many
operating systems have additional features to define more complex access
rights, for example ACLs (Access Control Lists). For such environments, ""use
filetest"" may help the permission operators to return results more consistent
with other tools.
The Opcode module allows you to define an operator mask to be in effect when
perl next compiles any code. Attempting to compile code which contains
a masked opcode will cause the compilation to fail with an error. The code
will not be executed.
Contemporary Perl still refers to some Perl header (ph) files although it does
not build them anymore. This is a prebuilt collection of the referred files.
If you miss other ones, you can generate them with h2ph tool from perl-utils
package.
The DynaLoader module defines a standard generic interface to the dynamic
linking mechanisms available on many platforms. Its primary purpose is to
implement automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules. For a simpler interface,
see XSLoader module.
Semaphores provide a mechanism to regulate access to resources. Unlike locks,
semaphores aren't tied to particular scalars, and so may be used to control
access to anything you care to use them for. Semaphores don't limit their
values to zero and one, so they can be used to control access to some resource
that there may be more than one of (e.g., file handles). Increment and
decrement amounts aren't fixed at one either, so threads can reserve or return
multiple resources at once.
As of Perl 5.26.0, this module has no effect. The internal Perl feature that
was used to implement this module has been removed.  Hence, if you load this
module on Perl 5.26.0, you will get one warning that the module is no longer
supported; and the module will do nothing thereafter.
This Thread module served as the front end to the old-style thread model,
called 5005threads, that has been removed in version 5.10.

For old code and interim backwards compatibility, the Thread module has been
reworked to function as a front end for the new interpreter threads (ithreads)
model. However, some previous functionality is not available. Further, the
data sharing models between the two thread models are completely different,
and anything to do with data sharing has to be thought differently.

You are strongly encouraged to migrate any existing threaded code to the new
model (i.e., use the threads and threads::shared modules) as soon as possible.
IO::Zlib provides an IO:: style interface to Compress::Zlib and hence to
gzip/zlib-compressed files. It provides many of the same methods as the
IO::Handle interface.
This is a Perl interpreter as a standalone executable /usr/bin/perl
required for handling Perl scripts. It does not provide all the other Perl
modules or tools.

Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your system to

If your script requires some Perl modules, you can install them with
""perl(MODULE)"" where ""MODULE"" is a name of required module. E.g. install
""perl(Test::More)"" to make Test::More Perl module available.

Perl header files can be found in perl-devel package.

Perl utils like ""h2ph"" or ""perlbug"" can be found in perl-utils package.

Perl debugger, usually invoked with ""perl -d"", is available in perl-debugger
package.
The sigtrap pragma is a simple interface for installing signal handlers.
This is the perl debugger. It is loaded automatically by Perl when you invoke
a script with ""perl -d"". There is also ""DB"" module contained for
a programmatic interface to the debugging API.

",perl,"Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.

This is a metapackage with all the Perl bits and core modules that can be
found in the upstream tarball from perl.org.

If you need only a specific feature, you can install a specific package
instead. E.g. to handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter,
install perl-interpreter package. See perl-interpreter description for more
details on the Perl decomposition into packages.",Practical Extraction and Report Language,"perl-FileCache

including renaming imported functions with the -as, -prefix and -suffix
options; explicit destinations with the into option; and alternative
installers with the installer option. But it's written in only about 40%
as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.

Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration
done through the @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables.

Exporter::Tiny performs most of its internal duties (including resolution of
tag names to sub names, resolution of sub names to coderefs, and installation
of coderefs into the target package) as method calls, which means they can be
overridden to provide interesting behavior.",An exporter with the features of Sub::Exporter but only core dependencies,"perl-Exporter-Tiny

a Device DAX device.  Since the standard I/O APIs (read/write) cannot be used
with Device DAX, data transfer is performed on a memory-mapped device.
The daxio may be used to dump Device DAX data to a file, restore data from
a backup copy, move/copy data to another device or to erase data from
a device.
The librpmem library provides low-level support for remote access
to persistent memory utilizing RDMA-capable NICs. It can be used
to replicate persistent memory regions over RDMA protocol.
The rpmemd process is executed on a target node by librpmem library
and facilitates access to persistent memory over RDMA.
The libvmmalloc library transparently converts all the dynamic memory
allocations into persistent memory allocations. This allows the use
of persistent memory as volatile memory without modifying the target
application.

The typical usage of libvmmalloc is to load it via the LD_PRELOAD
environment variable.
The pmreorder tool is a collection of python scripts designed to parse
and replay operations logged by pmemcheck - a persistent memory checking tool.
Pmreorder performs the store reordering between persistent memory barriers -
a sequence of flush-fence operations. It uses a consistency checking routine
provided in the command line options to check whether files are in a consistent state.
The libvmem library turns a pool of persistent memory into a volatile
memory pool, similar to the system heap but kept separate and with
its own malloc-style API.

eases the transition from other container engines and allows the management of
pods, containers and images.  Simply put: alias docker=podman.
Most podman commands can be run as a regular user, without requiring
additional privileges.

podman uses Buildah(1) internally to create container images.
Both tools share image (not container) storage, hence each can use or
manipulate images (but not containers) created by the other.

large InfiniBand fabrics by providing a user space implementation of what
is functionally similar to an ARP cache.  The use of ibacm, when properly

to O(n).  The ibacm daemon is started and normally runs in the background,
user applications need not know about this daemon as long as their app
uses librdmacm to handle connection bring up/tear down.  The librdmacm

it allows to restore to different hardware and can therefore be used as
a migration tool as well.

Currently Relax-and-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE,
OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl.
sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) as well as a multitude of backup strategies
(incl.  IBM TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker,
Bacula, Bareos, BORG, Duplicity, rsync).

Relax-and-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance
and is there to assist when disaster strikes. Its setup-and-forget nature
removes any excuse for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented.

(by default, a TCPSocket, but can be set by the Proxy option to new()). This
provides methods such as close() to end the session and sysread() to read data
directly from the host, instead of via the waitfor() mechanism. Note that if
you do use sysread() directly when in telnet mode, you should probably pass
the output through preprocess() to extract telnet command sequences.
Psych is a YAML parser and emitter. Psych leverages
libyaml[http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML] for its YAML parsing and emitting
capabilities. In addition to wrapping libyaml, Psych also knows how to
serialize and de-serialize most Ruby objects to and from the YAML format.

This is a implementation of the JSON specification according to RFC 4627.
You can think of it as a low fat alternative to XML, if you want to store
data to disk or transmit it over a network rather than use a verbose
markup language.
IO/Console provides very simple and portable access to console. It doesn't
provide higher layer features, such like curses and readline.
Ruby provides built-in support for arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.
For example:

42**13 -> 1265437718438866624512

BigDecimal provides similar support for very large or very accurate floating
point numbers. Decimal arithmetic is also useful for general calculation,
because it provides the correct answers people expect__hereas normal binary
floating point arithmetic often introduces subtle errors because of the
conversion between base 10 and base 2.
The irb is acronym for Interactive Ruby.  It evaluates ruby expression

REXML was inspired by the Electric XML library for Java, which features an
easy-to-use API, small size, and speed. Hopefully, REXML, designed with the same
philosophy, has these same features. I've tried to keep the API as intuitive as
possible, and have followed the Ruby methodology for method naming and code
flow, rather than mirroring the Java API.

REXML supports both tree and stream document parsing. Stream parsing is faster
(about 1.5 times as fast). However, with stream parsing, you don't get access to
features such as XPath.
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a family of formats that describe 'feeds',
specially constructed XML documents that allow an interested person to subscribe

TypeProf performs a type analysis of non-annotated Ruby code.
It abstractly executes input Ruby code in a level of types instead of values,
gathers what types are passed to and returned by methods, and prints the
analysis result in RBS format, a standard type description format for Ruby
3.0.

SCons ""configuration files"" are Python scripts, eliminating the need
to learn a new build tool syntax. SCons maintains a global view of
all dependencies in a tree, and can scan source (or other) files for
implicit dependencies, such as files specified on #include lines. SCons
uses MD5 signatures to rebuild only when the contents of a file have
really changed, not just when the timestamp has been touched. SCons
supports side-by-side variant builds, and is easily extended with user-

texlive-20180414-25.0.1.an8.src.rpm,,,"latexconfig package
Packages providing XML parsing, UTF-8 parsing, Unicode
entities, and common formatting object definitions for jadetex.
A pair of documents to reveal the font features supported by
fonts usable in XeTeX. Use OpenType-info.tex for OpenType
fonts, and AAT-info.tex for AAT fonts (Mac OS X only).
texconfig allows one to configure and maintain TeX in an easy
and convenient manner, offering a series of dialog boxes to
the user. The directory in which texconfig is found is also
preferentially used to find subprograms.
The package provides support for the manipulation and reference
of small or 'sub' figures and tables within a single figure or
table environment. It is convenient to use this package when
your subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or
are to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \subfigure
command is introduced which can be used inside a figure
environment for each subfigure. An optional first argument is
used as the caption for that subfigure. This package supersedes
the subfigure package (which will continue to be supported, but
no longer maintained). The name has changed because the subfig
package is not completely backward compatible with the older
subfigure package due to an extensive rewrite to use the new
caption package to produce its subcaptions. The major advantage
to the new package is that the user interface is keyword/value
driven and easier to use. To ease the transition from the
subfigure package it includes a configuration file (subfig.cfg)
which nearly emulates the subfigure package.
Allows LaTeX constructions (equations, picture environments,
etc.) to be precisely superimposed over Encapsulated PostScript
figures, using your own favorite drawing tool to create an EPS
figure and placing simple text 'tags' where each replacement is
to be placed, with PSfrag automatically removing these tags
from the figure and replacing them with a user specified LaTeX
construction, properly aligned, scaled, and/or rotated.
This package provides user control over the layout of the three
basic list environments: enumerate, itemize and description. It
supersedes both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well-
structured replacements for all their funtionality), and in
addition provides functions to compute the layout of labels,
and to 'clone' the standard environments, to create new
environments with counters of their own.
This package provides a way to typeset LaTeX source code and
the related result in the same document.
The package provides emulation of pdfTeX primitives for LuaTeX
v0.85+.
The lettrine package supports various dropped capitals styles,
typically those described in the French typographic books. In
particular, it has facilities for the paragraph text's left
edge to follow the outline of capitals that have a regular
shape (such as ""A"" and ""V"").
Martin Vogel's Symbol font (marvosym) contains the Euro
currency symbol as defined by the European commission, along
with symbols for structural engineering; symbols for steel
cross-sections; astronomy signs (sun, moon, planets); the 12
signs of the zodiac; scissor symbols; CE sign and others. The
package contains both the original TrueType font and the
derived Type 1 font, together with support files for TeX
(LaTeX).
The varwidth environment is superficially similar to minipage,
but the specified width is just a maximum value -- the box may
get a narrower ""natural"" width.
The bundle comprises: - authblk, which permits footnote style
author/affiliation input in the \author command, - balance, to
balance the end of \twocolumn pages, - figcaps, to send figure
captions, etc., to end document, - fullpage, to set narrow page
margins and set a fixed page style, and - sublabel, which
permits counters to be subnumbered.
The package provides commands that display the value of a LaTeX
counter in a variety of formats (ordinal, text, hexadecimal,
decimal, octal, binary etc). The package offers some
multilingual support; configurations for use in English (both
British and American usage), French (including Belgian and
Swiss variants), German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish
documents are provided. This package was originally provided as
part of the author's datetime package, but is now distributed
separately.
The commands \import{full_path}{file} and
\subimport{path_extension}{file} set up input through standard
LaTeX mechanisms (\input, \include and \includegraphics) to
load files relative to the \import-ed directory. There are also
\includefrom, \subincludefrom, and * variants of the commands.
LaTeX is a widely-used macro package for TeX, providing many
basic document formating commands extended by a wide range of
packages. It is a development of Leslie Lamport's original
LaTeX 2.09, and superseded the older system in June 1994. The
basic distribution is catalogued separately, at latex-base;
apart from a large set of contributed packages and third-party
documentation (elsewhere on the archive), the distribution
includes: - a bunch of required packages, which LaTeX authors
are ""entitled to assume"" will be present on any system running
LaTeX; and - a minimal set of documentation detailing
differences from the 'old' version of LaTeX in the areas of
user commands, font selection and control, class and package
writing, font encodings, configuration options and modification
of LaTeX. For downloading details, see the linked catalogue
entries above.
Provides support for the manipulation and reference of small or

subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or are
to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \subfigure command

caption for that subfigure. This package is now obsolescent:
new users should use subfig instead.
Latin Modern Math is a maths companion for the Latin Modern
family of fonts, in OpenType format. For use with LuaLaTeX or
XeLaTeX, support is available from the unicode-math package.
The package allows the to user select any font size (via e.g.
\fontsize{...}{...}\selectfont), even those sizes that are not
listed in the .fd file. If such a size is requested, LaTeX will
search for and select the nearest listed size; anyfontsize will
then scale the font to the size actually requested. Similar
functionality is available for the CM family, for the EC
family, or for either computer modern encoding; the present
package generalises the facility.
The package allows the user to include several bibliographies
covering different 'topics' or bibliographic material into a
document (e.g., one bibliography for primary literature and one
for secondary literature). The package provides commands to
include either all references from a .bib file, only the
references actually cited or those not cited in your document.
The user has to construct a separate .bib file for each
bibliographic 'topic', each of which will be processed
separately by BibTeX. If you want to have bibliographies
specific to one part of a document, see the packages bibunits
or chapterbib.
Typewriter-style fonts are best for program listings, but
Computer Modern Typewriter prints ` and ' as bent opening and
closing single quotes. Other fonts, and most programming
languages, print ` as a grave accent and ' upright; ' is used
both to open and to close quoted strings. The package switches
the typewriter font to Computer Modern Typewriter in OT1
encoding, and modifies the behaviour of verbatim, verbatim*,
\verb, and \verb* to print in the ""` and ' way"". It does
thisregardless of other fonts or encodings in use, so long as
the package is loaded after the other fonts were. The package
does not affect \tt, \texttt, etc.
The package was designed to accommodate all needs for inclusion
of graphics in LaTeX documents, replacing many earlier packages
used in LaTeX 2.09. The package aims to give a consistent
interface to including the file types that are understood in
your output, by use of 'printer drivers' (now known, simply, as
'drivers'). The distribtion of the package contains several
drivers, but others (for example, pdfTeX) are distributed
separately. The package also offers several means of
manipulating graphics in the course of inserting them into a
document (for example, rotation and scaling). For extended
documentation see epslatex. The package is part of the graphics
bundle, which is one of the collections in the LaTeX 'required'
set of packages.
This package exposes spacing parameters for various TeX logos
to the end user, to optimise the logos for different fonts.
Written especially for XeLaTeX users.
Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need
hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems
require hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font
in use (such encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with
names like OT1, T2A, TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package
offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-
8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in
older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style
TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the
UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant
the older patterns.
The package provides the switch \ifetex which indicates whether
e-TeX is available or not. The package can be loaded as LaTeX
package using \usepackage{ifetex} or in plain TeX using \input
ifetex. In either case it aborts silently if the \ifetex macro
is already defined. The package's test is whether \eTeXversion
is defined as a primitive; if it is, the package assumes e-TeX
features are available.
Starting with PDF 1.3 (Adobe Acrobat 4.0), PDF files can
contain file attachments -- arbitrary files that a reader can
extract, just like attachments to an e-mail message. The
attachfile package brings this functionality to pdfLaTeX and
provides some additional features not available in Acrobat,
such as the ability to use arbitrary LaTeX code for the file
icon -- including things like \includegraphics, tabular, and
mathematics. Settings can be made either globally or on a per-
attachment basis. Attachfile makes it easy to attach files and
customize their appearance in the enclosing document. The
package supports the Created, Modified, and Size keys in the
EmbeddedFile's Params dictionary.
This package contains the files needed to get the TeX Live
tools (notably tlmgr) running: perl modules, xz binaries, plus
(sometimes) tar and wget.  These files end up in the standalone
install packages, and in the tlcritical repository.
The package patches a few commands of the LaTeX2e kernel and
the amsmath and mathtools packages to be more compatible with
the LuaTeX engine. It is only meaningful for LuaLaTeX documents
containing mathematical formulas, and does not exhibit any new
functionality. The fixes are mostly moved from the unicode-math
package to this package since they are not directly related to
Unicode mathematics typesetting.
The philokalia package has been designed to ease the use of the
Philokalia-Regular OpenType font with XeLaTeX. The font started
as a project to digitize the typeface used to typeset the
Philokalia books.
LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an
embedded scripting language. The LuaTeX project's main
objective is to provide an open and configurable variant of TeX
while at the same time offering downward compatibility. LuaTeX
uses Unicode (as UTF-8) as its default input encoding, and is
able to use modern (OpenType) fonts (for both text and
mathematics). It should be noted that LuaTeX is still under
development; its specification has been declared stable, but
absolute stability may not in practice be assumed.
Adds line numbers to selected paragraphs with reference
possible through the LaTeX \ref and \pageref cross reference
mechanism. Line numbering may be extended to footnote lines,
using the fnlineno package.
This package extends the ifthen package by implementing new
commands to go within the first argument of \ifthenelse: to
test whether a string is void or not, if a command is defined
or equivalent to another. The package also enables use of
complex expressions as introduced by the package calc, together
with the ability of defining new commands to handle complex
tests. The package requires e-TeX features.
A small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard'
PostScript fonts. It is basically a merger of the times and the
(obsolete) mathptm packages from the psnfss suite. You must
have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts
to use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex
package tries to compensate for the visual differences between
the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing'
Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is
supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that
allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without
needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a
different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available
now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,
pslatex is widely considered obsolete.
This collection of tools includes: - support for short commands
starting with @, - macros to sanitise the OT1 encoding of the
cmtt fonts; - a 'do after' command; - improved footnote
support; - mathenv for various alignment in maths; - list
handling; - mdwmath which adds some minor changes to LaTeX
maths; - a rewrite of LaTeX's tabular and array environments; -
verbatim handling; and - syntax diagrams.
Defines a command \captionof for putting a caption to something
that's not a float. Note that the caption package includes a
\captionof command that is an extension of that provided by
this package.
EncTeX is (another) tex extension, written at the change-file
level. It provides means of translating input on the way into
TeX. It allows, for example, translation of multibyte
sequences, such as utf-8 encoding.
Packages to convert LaTeX to XML/HTML, and typeset XML/SGML.
Provides commands to typeset centered, left- or right-aligned
table and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes. Instead of
an environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the first
is optional and is used for key,value pairs generating
variations on the defaults and offering a route for future
extensions.
The package contains the Bera Type 1 fonts, and a zip archive
containing files to use the fonts with LaTeX. Bera is a set of
three font families: Bera Serif (a slab-serif Roman), Bera Sans
(a Frutiger descendant), and Bera Mono (monospaced/typewriter).
Support for use in LaTeX is also provided. The Bera family is a
repackaging, for use with TeX, of the Bitstream Vera family.
The l3experimental packages are a collection of experimental
implementations for aspects of the LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with
higher-level ideas such as the Designer Interface. Some of them
work as stand alone packages, providing new functionality, and
can be used on top of LaTeX2e with no changes to the existing
kernel. The present release includes: - xgalley, which controls
boxes receiving text for typesetting. - l3dt: kernel support
for data tables; - l3galley: kernel support for xgalley; -
l3regex: kernel support for regular expression search and
replace operations; - l3sort: kernel support for sorting
sequences, token lists or comma-lists, according to user-
specified comparison criteria; - l3str: kernel support for
string manipulation; - l3tl-build: kernel support for token
list building; - l3tl_analysis: kernel support for token list
analysis; and - xcoffins, which allows the alignment of boxes
using a series of 'handle' positions, supplementing the simple
TeX reference point. All the files of the bundle are also
available in the Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3
Project.
Pst-coil is a PSTricks based package for coils and zigzags and
for coil and zigzag node connections.
This is the basic TeX Live scheme: it is a small set of files
sufficient to typeset plain TeX or LaTeX documents in
PostScript or PDF, using the Computer Modern fonts.  This
scheme corresponds to collection-basic and collection-latex.
Can handle almost all of HTML2, and most of the math fragment
of the draft HTML3.
MnSymbol is a symbol font family, designed to be used in
conjunction with Adobe Minion Pro (via the MinionPro package).
Almost all of LaTeX and AMS mathematical symbols are provided;
remaining coverage is available from the MinionPro font with
the MinionPro package. The fonts are available in both MetaFont
and Adobe Type 1 formats, and a comprehensive support package
is provided. While the fonts were designed to fit with Minon
Pro, the design should fit well with other renaissance or
baroque faces: indeed, it will probably work with most fonts
that are neither too wide nor too thin, for example Palatino or
Times; it is known to look good with Sabon. There is no package
designed to configure its use with any font other than Minion
Pro, but (for example) simply loading mnsymbol after mathpazo
will probably do what is needed.
Macro package on top of LaTeX to typeset TeX output of the Jade
DSSSL implementation.
The package provides commands to change the page layout in the
middle of a document, and to robustly check for typesetting on
odd or even pages. Instructions for use are at the end of the
file. The package is an extraction of code from the memoir
class, whose user interface it shares. It is intended the this
package will eventually replace the chngpage package, which is
distributed with the package.
The caption package provides many ways to customise the
captions in floating environments like figure and table, and
cooperates with many other packages. Facilities include
rotating captions, sideways captions, continued captions (for
tables or figures that come in several parts). A list of
compatibility notes, for other packages, is provided in the
documentation. The package also provides the ""caption outside
float"" facility, in the same way that simpler packages like
capt-of do. The package supersedes caption2.
Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
Modern-style font from Monotype. The family is comprehensive,
offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font,
together with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the
mathematical facilities of TeX itself. The base fonts are
distributed as Metafont source, but autotraced PostScript Type
1 versions are available (one version in the AMS fonts
distribution, and also the BaKoMa distribution). The Computer
Modern fonts have inspired many later families, notably the
European Computer Modern and the Latin Modern families.
This package provides the command \marginnote that may be used
instead of \marginpar at almost every place where \marginpar
cannot be used, e.g., inside floats, footnotes, or in frames
made with the framed package.
Provides enumerate and itemize environments that can be used
within paragraphs to format the items either as running text or
as separate paragraphs with a preceding number or symbol. Also
provides compacted versions of enumerate and itemize.
A bundle of packages that arise in the author's area of
interest: - compliance of maths typesetting with ISO standards;
- symbols that work in both maths and text modes; - commas for
both decimal separator and maths; and - upright Greek letters
in maths.
The package provides an \ul (underline) command which will
break over line ends; this technique may be used to replace \em
(both in that form and as the \emph command), so as to make
output look as if it comes from a typewriter. The package also
offers double and wavy underlining, and striking out (line
through words) and crossing out (/// over words). The package
works with both Plain TeX and LaTeX.
The package provides lipsum-like facilities for the Persian
language. The source of the filling text is the Persian epic
""the Shanameh"" (100 paragraphs are used.)
Designed for use with xdvi and dvips this utility converts
Adobe Type 1 fonts to PK bitmap format. It should not
ordinarily be much used nowadays, since both its target
applications are now capable of dealing with Type 1 fonts,
direct.
cmextra package
The T2 bundle provides a variety of separate support functions,
for using Cyrillic characters in LaTeX: - the mathtext package,
for using Cyrillic letters 'transparently' in formulae - the
citehack package, for using Cyrillic (or indeed any non-ascii)
characters in citation keys; - support for Cyrillic in BibTeX;
- support for Cyrillic in Makeindex; and - various items of
font support.
ifoddpage package
Typeset programs (programming code) within LaTeX. The source
code is read directly by TeX. Keywords, comments and strings
can be typeset using different styles (default is bold for
keywords, italic for comments and no special style for
strings). Includes support for hyperref. To use, simply
\usepackage{listings}, identify the language with
\lstset{language=Python}, then employ the \begin{lstlisting}
... \end{lstlisting} environment or the
\lstinputlisting{filename.py} command. Short (in-line) listings
are also available, using either \lstinline|...| or | ... |
(after defining the | token with the \lstMakeShortInline
command).
ltxmisc package
A general purpose hierarchical index generator; it accepts one
or more input files (often produced by a text formatter such as
TeX or troff), sorts the entries, and produces an output file
which can be formatted. The formats of the input and output
files are specified in a style file; by default, input is
assumed to be an .idx file, as generated by LaTeX.
The KOMA-Script bundle provides drop-in replacements for the
article/report/book classes with emphasis on typography and
versatility. There is also a letter class, different from all
other letter classes. It also offers e.g. a package for
calculated type areas in the way laid down by the typographer
Jan Tschichold, a package for easily changing and defining of
page styles, a package for getting not only the current date
but also the name of day and a package for getting current
time. All these packages may be used not only with KOMA-Script
classes but also with standard classes. Since every package has
its own version number, the number below is only the version of
scrbook, scrreprt, scrartcl, scrlttr2 and typearea. These are
the main parts of the bundle.
Pst-fill is a PSTricks-based package for filling and tiling
areas or characters.
The package offers access to the large number of web-related
icons provided by the included font. The package requires the
package, fontspec, if run with XeTeX or LuaTeX.
The package loads the fixltx2e package from the LaTeX
distribution, and etex.sty from the e-TeX distribution. The
package then patches the \- (discretionary hyphen command) to
use the current hyphen character (which may be different from
than the default, which is the character at the ASCII hyphen
slot), and loads the realscripts to patch the \textsuperscript
command (from the LaTeX kernel) and the \textsubscript command
(from the fixltx2e package). The package is loaded by the
fontspec package, so that it should not ordinarily be necessary
to load it explicitly. The package relies on the metalogo
package for typesetting the XeTeX and XeLaTeX logos.
Provides a style with author-year and numbered references, as
well as much detailed of support for other bibliography use.
Provides versions of the standard BibTeX styles that are
compatible with natbib - plainnat, unsrtnat, abbrnat. The
bibliography styles produced by custom-bib are designed from
the start to be compatible with natbib.
The package provides a means of producing a 'book' of font
samples (for evaluation, etc.).
A collection of programs for processing the output of Metafont.
The package provides a map for use with Jonathan Kew's TECkit,
to translate Tibetan to Unicode (range 0F00-0FFF).
Includes install-tl, tl-portable, rungs, etc.; not needed for
tlmgr to run but still ours.  Not included in tlcritical.
This bundle provides a collection of model .ini files for
creating TeX formats. These files are commonly used to
introduced distribution-dependent variations in formats. They
are also used to allow existing format source files to be used
with newer engines, for example to adapt the plain e-TeX source
file to work with XeTeX and LuaTeX.
The hyperref package is used to handle cross-referencing
commands in LaTeX to produce hypertext links in the document.
The package provides backends for the \special set defined for
HyperTeX DVI processors; for embedded pdfmark commands for
processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and Y&Y's dvipsone); for
Y&Y's dviwindo; for PDF control within pdfTeX and dvipdfm; for
TeX4ht; and for VTeX's pdf and HTML backends. The package is
distributed with the backref and nameref packages, which make
use of the facilities of hyperref. The package depends on the
author's kvoptions, ltxcmdsand refcount packages.
The bundle holds prototype implementations of concepts for a
LaTeX designer interface, to be used with the experimental
LaTeX kernel as programming tools and kernel support. Packages
provided in this release are: - l3keys2e, which makes the
facilities of the kernel module l3keys available for use by
LaTeX 2e packages; - xfrac, which provides flexible split-level
fractions; - xparse, which provides a high-level interface for
declaring document commands; and - xtemplate, which provides a
means of defining generic functions using a key-value syntax.
All the files of the bundle are also available in the
Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3 Project.
This package has been withdrawn from CTAN, and bundled into the
distributions' package sets. The current sources of dvips may
be found in the distribution of dvipsk which forms part of the
TeX-live sources.
This package has all the code from the package pstricks-add
which was related to arrows, like multiple arrows and so on.
ArabXeTeX provides a convenient ArabTeX-like user-interface for
typesetting languages using the Arabic script in XeLaTeX, with
flexible access to font features. Input in ArabTeX notation can
be set in three different vocalization modes or in roman
transliteration. Direct UTF-8 input is also supported. The
parsing and converting of ArabTeX input to Unicode is done by
means of TECkit mappings. Version 1.0 provides support for
Arabic, Maghribi Arabic, Farsi (Persian), Urdu, Sindhi,
Kashmiri, Ottoman Turkish, Kurdish, Jawi (Malay) and Uighur.
The documentation (not yet complete) covers topics such as
typesetting the Holy Quran, typesetting bidirectional critical
editions (with ednotes), and information on various recommended
OpenType fonts for the Arabic script and for transliterating
Oriental languages.
This package can disable all hyphenation or enable hyphenation
of non-alphabetics or monospaced fonts. The package can also
enable hyphenation within 'words' that contain non-alphabetic
characters (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of
text typeset in monospaced (e.g., cmtt) fonts.
A collection of ways to change the typesetting of footnotes.
The package provides means of changing the layout of the
footnotes themselves (including setting them in 'paragraphs' --
the para option), a way to number footnotes per page (the
perpage option), to make footnotes disappear when an argument
moves (stable option) and to deal with multiple references to
footnotes from the same place (multiple option). The package
also has a range of techniques for labelling footnotes with
symbols rather than numbers. Some of the functions of the
package are overlap with the functionality of other packages.
The para option is also provided by the manyfoot and bigfoot
packages, though those are both also portmanteau packages.
(Don't be seduced by fnpara, whose implementation is improved
by the present package.) The perpage option is also offered by
footnpag and by the rather more general-purpose perpage
A simple package which provides an \ifxetex conditional, so
that other code can determine that it is running under XeTeX.
The package requires the e-TeX extensions to the TeX primitive
set.
These are the wasy (Waldi symbol) fonts, second release. This
bundle presents the fonts in Metafont format, but they are also
available in Adobe Type 1 format. Support under LaTeX is
provided by the wasysym package.
Miscellaneous macros by Jorg Knappen, including: - represent
counters in greek; - Maxwell's non-commutative division; -
latin1jk, latin2jk and latin3jk, which are their inputenc
definition files that allow verbatim input in the respective
ISO Latin codes; - blackboard bold fonts in maths; - use of
RSFS fonts in maths; - extra alignments for \parboxes; - swap
Roman and Sans fonts; - transliterate semitic languages; -
patches to make (La)TeX formulae embeddable in SGML; - use
maths ""minus"" in text as appropriate; - simple Young tableaux.
norasi-c90 package
PostScript lacks a lot of basic operators such as tan, acos,
asin, cosh, sinh, tanh, acosh, asinh, atanh, exp (with e base).
Also (oddly) cos and sin use arguments in degrees. Pst-math
provides all those operators in a header file pst-math.pro with
wrappers pst-math.sty and pst-math.tex. In addition, sinc,
gauss, gammaln and bessel are implemented (only partially for
the latter). pst-math is designed essentially to work with pst-
plot but can be used in whatever PS code (such as pstricks
SpecialCoor ""!"", which is useful for placing labels). The
package also provides a routine SIMPSON for numerical
integration and a solver of linear equation systems.
The package provides several file hooks (AtBegin, AtEnd, ...)
for files read by \input, \include and \InputIfFileExists.
General hooks for all such files (e.g. all \include'd ones) and
file specific hooks only used for named files are provided; two
hooks are provided for the end of \included files -- one
before, and one after the final \clearpage.
Provides variants of \fbox: \shadowbox, \doublebox, \ovalbox,
\Ovalbox, with helpful tools for using box macros and flexible
verbatim macros. You can box mathematics, floats, center,
flushleft, and flushright, lists, and pages.
The package supports compressed, sorted lists of numerical
citations, and also deals with various punctuation and other
issues of representation, including comprehensive management of
break points. The package is compatible with both hyperref and
backref. The package is (unsurprisingly) part of the cite
bundle of the author's citation-related packages.
A set of virtual fonts which emulates T1 coded fonts using the
standard CM fonts. The package name, AE fonts, supposedly
stands for ""Almost European"". The main use of the package was
to produce PDF files using Adobe Type 1 versions of the CM
fonts instead of bitmapped EC fonts. Note that direct
substitutes for the bitmapped EC fonts are now available, via
the CM-super, Latin Modern and (in a restricted way) CM-LGC
font sets.
manfnt-font package
teTeX was a comprehensive distribution of TeX, LaTeX and
family, designed for ease of compilation, installation and
customisation. In 2006, Thomas Esser announced he would no
longer be able to support, or to produce new versions of,
teTeX. With the appearance of TeX live 2007 (whose Unix-system
TeX support originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be
using teTeX at all, in new applications. One of the ""schemes""
available when installing TeX live provides a configuration
very close to that of the old teTeX, but using modern versions
of programs and packages.
Dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) is a development of dvipdfm
created to support multi-byte character encodings and large
character sets for East Asian languages. Dvipdfmx, if ""called""
with the name dvipdfm, operates in a ""dvipdfm compatibility""
mode, so that users of the both packages need only keep one
executable. A secondary design goal is to support as many ""PDF""
features as does pdfTeX. There being no documentation as such,
users are advised to consult the documentation of dvipdfm (as
well, of course, as the package Readme.
The pst-3d package provides basic macros for shadows, tilting
and three dimensional representations of text or graphical
objects.
The beamer LaTeX class can be used for producing slides. Its
functionality is similar to Prosper but does not need any
external programs and can directly produce a presentation using
pdflatex. Beamer uses pgf for pdf/ps independent graphics.

multiple slides throu",,,,,,应用工具

Provides support for IBTA-compliant transports for UCX. This includes RoCE,
InfiniBand, OmniPath, and any other transport supported by IB Verbs API.
Typically these transports provide RDMA support, which enables a fast and
hardware-offloaded data transfer.
UCX is an optimized communication framework for high-performance distributed
applications. UCX utilizes high-speed networks, such as RDMA (InfiniBand, RoCE,
etc), Cray Gemini or Aries, for inter-node communication. If no such network is
available, TCP is used instead. UCX supports efficient transfer of data in
either main memory (RAM) or GPU memory (through CUDA and ROCm libraries). In
addition, UCX provides efficient intra-node communication, by leveraging the
following shared memory mechanisms: posix, sysv, cma, knem, and xpmem.
The acronym UCX stands for ""Unified Communication X"".

This package was built from '' branch, commit ef2bbcf.

xmlstreambuffer-1.5.4-8.module+an8.5.0+10626+b7948c75.src.rpm,,,"A stream buffer is a stream-based representation of an XML
info-set in Java. Stream buffers are designed to: provide
very efficient stream-based memory representations of XML
info-sets; and be created and processed using any Java-based
XML API.
Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation
used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial
difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:
* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or
* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required
 and need to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like
 SAX or StAX.

This package provides XMvn Core module, which implements the essential
functionality of XMvn such as resolution of artifacts from system
repository.
This package provides XMvn parent POM.
This package provides XMvn Subst, which is a tool that can substitute
Maven artifact files with symbolic links to corresponding files in
artifact repository.
This package provides XMvn Connector for Maven Resolver, which
provides integration of Maven Resolver with XMvn.  It provides an
adapter which allows XMvn resolver to be used as Maven workspace
reader.
This package provides XMvn Connector for Apache Ivy, which provides

Xdmx is proxy X server that provides multi-head support for multiple displays
attached to different machines (each of which is running a typical X server).
When Xinerama is used with Xdmx, the multiple displays on multiple machines
are presented to the user as a single unified screen.  A simple application
for Xdmx would be to provide multi-head support using two desktop machines,
each of which has a single display device attached to it.  A complex
application for Xdmx would be to unify a 4 by 4 grid of 1280x1024 displays
(each attached to one of 16 computers) into a unified 5120x4096 display.

ZVBI provides functions to capture and decode VBI data. The vertical blanking
interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal that temporarily suspends
transmission of the signal for the electron gun to move back up to the first
line of the television screen to trace the next screen field. The vertical
blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything sent during the VBI
would naturally not be displayed; various test signals, closed captioning, and
other digital data can be sent during this time period.
