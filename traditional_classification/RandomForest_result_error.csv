ranking in a sorted set.

by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like

format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.
