work around a regression in a driver or to try an experimental alternative
driver. Another common use-case is pass-through drivers and driver
stubs to allow userspace to drive the device, such as in case of
virtualization.

driverctl integrates with udev to support overriding
driver selection for both cold- and hotplugged devices from the
moment of discovery, but can also change already assigned drivers,
assuming they are not in use by the system. The driver overrides
created by driverctl are persistent across system reboots

dwarves,应用, Debugging Information Manipulation Tools (pahole & friends)," dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in
ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as
GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results.",系统

command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.

the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime

libffi,系统,A portable foreign function interface library ,"Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages. ",系统

typically ppport.h, attempts to bring some of the newer Perl API features
to older versions of Perl, so that you can worry less about keeping track
of old releases, but users can still reap the benefit.",系统
perl-Devel-StackTrace,系统, Perl module implementing stack trace and stack trace frame objects," The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace
and Devel::StackTraceFrame.  The goal of this object is to encapsulate
the information that can found through using the caller() function, as
well as providing a simple interface to this data.

The Devel::StackTrace object contains a set of Devel::StackTraceFrame

perl-Digest,系统, Modules that calculate message digests," The Digest:: modules calculate digests, also called ""fingerprints"" or

""fingerprint"" or ""message digest"" of the input.

The Digest::SHA1 module provide a procedural interface for simple use,

arbitrary length and which can read files directly.

A binary digest will be 20 bytes long. A hex digest will be 40
characters long. A base64 digest will be 27 characters long.",系统
perl-Dist-CheckConflicts,系统, Declare version conflicts for your dist," One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This module
attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to specify conflicting
versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the module is done
installing.

For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo. If
Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause
Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend on
the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency
(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intent
properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be for
there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would
let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existing
module is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to do
this manually.",系统
perl-DynaLoader-Functions,系统, Deconstructed dynamic C library loading," This module provides a function-based interface to dynamic loading as used

way out.",系统
perl-Error,系统, Error/exception handling in an OO-ish way," The Error package provides two interfaces. Firstly Error provides a

perl-Eval-Closure,系统, Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval," String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses
it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which
speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without
its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly).",系统

installers with the installer option. But it's written in only about 40%
as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.

Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration
done through the @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables.

Exporter::Tiny performs most of its internal duties (including resolution of
tag names to sub names, resolution of sub names to coderefs, and installation
of coderefs into the target package) as method calls, which means they can be

perl-Test-NoWarnings,系统, Make sure you didn't emit any warnings while testing," In general, your tests shouldn't produce warnings. This module causes any
warnings to be captured and stored. It automatically adds an extra test
that will run when your script ends to check that there were no warnings.
If there were any warnings, the test will give a ""not ok"" and diagnostics of
where, when and what the warning was, including a stack trace of what was
going on when the it occurred.",系统
perl-Test-Warnings,系统, Test for warnings and the lack of them," If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan.",系统

can be a regular expression) and a list of lines and then breaks those lines
up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear inside quotes.
quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single long list, while
nested_quotewords() returns a list of token lists corresponding to the
elements of @lines. parse_line() does tokenizing on a single string. The
quotewords() functions simply call &parse_line(), so if you're only splitting
one line you can call parse_line() directly and save a function call.",系统
perl-Text-Tabs+Wrap,系统, Expand tabs and do simple line wrapping," Text::Tabs performs the same job that the UNIX expand(1) and unexpand(1)

perltidy,系统, Tool for indenting and re-formatting Perl scripts," Perltidy is a Perl script that indents and re-formats Perl scripts to

time reading them, you will probably find it useful. The formatting
can be controlled with command line parameters. The default parameter
settings approximately follow the suggestions in the Perl Style Guide.
Perltidy can also output HTML of both POD and source code. Besides
re-formatting scripts, Perltidy can be a great help in tracking down

perl-Time-Local,系统, Efficiently compute time from local and GMT time," This module provides functions that are the inverse of built-in perl functions
localtime() and gmtime(). They accept a date as a six-element array, and
return the corresponding time(2) value in seconds since the system epoch

perl-Try-Tiny,系统, Minimal try/catch with proper localization of $@," This module provides bare bones try/catch statements that are designed to
minimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.

This is unlike TryCatch, which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding
another call stack layer, and supports calling return from the try block to
return from the parent subroutine. These extra features come at a cost of a
few dependencies, namely Devel::Declare and Scope::Upper that are occasionally
problematic, and the additional catch filtering uses Moose type constraints,
which may not be desirable either.",系统

the MPICH effort. While PMI-2 demonstrates better scaling properties than its
PMI-1 predecessor, attaining rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M
processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations remains
challenging.

PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by
providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to
support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of
the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in
fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but
rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference
implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates the desired level of
scalability.",应用

system-storage-manager,系统,A single tool to manage your storage ,"System Storage Manager provides an easy to use command line interface to manage
your storage using various technologies like lvm, btrfs, encrypted volumes and

In more sophisticated enterprise storage environments, management with Device
Mapper (dm), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), or Multiple Devices (md) is becoming
increasingly more difficult.  With file systems added to the mix, the number of
tools needed to configure and manage storage has grown so large that it is
simply not user friendly.  With so many options for a system administrator to
consider, the opportunity for errors and problems is large.

The btrfs administration tools have shown us that storage management can be
simplified, and we are working to bring that ease of use to Linux file systems
in general.

You should install the ssm if you need to manage your storage with various
technologies via a single unified interface. ",应用

texlive-crop,应用, Support for cropmarks," A package providing corner marks for camera alignment as well
as for trimming paper stacks, and additional page information
on every page if required. Most macros are easily adaptable to
personal preferences. An option is provided for selectively
suppressing graphics or text, which may be useful for printing
just colour graphics on a colour laser printer and the rest on
a cheap mono laser printer. A page info line contains the time
and a new cropmarks index and is printed at the top of the
page. A configuration command is provided for the info line
font. Options for better collaboration with dvips, pdftex and
vtex are provided.",应用
texlive-currfile,应用, Provide file name and path of input files," The package provides macros holding file name information
(directory, base name, extension, full name and full path) for
files read by LaTeX \input and \include macros; it uses the
file hooks provided by the author's filehook. In particular, it
restores the parent file name after the trailing \clearpage of
an \included file; as a result, the macros may be usefully
employed in the page header and footer of the last printed page
of such a file. The depth of inclusion is made available,
together with the ""parent"" (including file) and ""parents"" (all
including files to the root of the tree). The package
supersedes FiNK.",应用
texlive-dvips,应用, A DVI to PostScript driver," This package has been withdrawn from CTAN, and bundled into the

texlive-epstopdf,应用, Convert EPS to 'encapsulated' PDF using Ghostscript," Epstopdf is a Perl script that converts an EPS file to an
'encapsulated' PDF file (a single page file whose media box is
the same as the original EPS's bounding box). The resulting
file suitable for inclusion by PDFTeX as an image. The script
is adapted to run both on Windows and on Unix-alike systems.
The script makes use of Ghostscript for the actual conversion
to PDF. It assumes Ghostscript version 6.51 or later, and (by
default) suppresses its automatic rotation of pages where most
of the text is not horizontal. LaTeX users may make use of the
epstopdf package, which will run the epstopdf script ""on the
fly"", thus giving the illusion that PDFLaTeX is accepting EPS
graphic files.",应用
texlive-eqparbox,应用, Create equal-widthed parboxes," LaTeX users sometimes need to ensure that two or more blocks of
text occupy the same amount of horizontal space on the page. To
that end, the eqparbox package defines a new command,
\eqparbox, which works just like \parbox, except that instead
of specifying a width, one specifies a tag. All eqparboxes with
the same tag--regardless of where they are in the document--
will stretch to fit the widest eqparbox with that tag. This
simple, equal-width mechanism can be used for a variety of
alignment purposes, as is evidenced by the examples in
eqparbox's documentation. Various derivatives of \eqparbox are
also provided.",应用
texlive-etex-pkg,应用, E-TeX support package," The package provides a straightforward interface to many of the
extensions offered by e-TeX; in particular, it modifies LaTeX's

range. The etoolbox and etextools packages provide macros that
make more sophisticated use of e-TeX's facilities.",应用
texlive-euro,应用, Provide Euro values for national currency amounts," Converts arbitrary national currency amounts using the Euro as
base unit, and typesets monetary amounts in almost any desired
way. Write, e.g., \ATS{17.6} to get something like '17,60 oS
(1,28 Euro)' automatically. Conversion rates for the initial
Euro-zone countries are already built-in. Further rates can be
added easily. The package uses the fp package to do its sums.",应用
texlive-extsizes,应用, Extend the standard classes' size options," Provides classes extarticle and extreport, extletter, extbook,
extproc which allow for documents with a base font of size 8-
20pt.",应用
texlive-fancyhdr,应用, Extensive control of page headers and footers in LaTeX2e," The package provides extensive facilities, both for
constructing headers and footers, and for controlling their use
(for example, at times when LaTeX would automatically change
the heading style in use).",应用
texlive-fancyref,应用, A LaTeX package for fancy cross-referencing," Provides fancy cross-referencing support, based on the
package's reference commands (\fref and \Fref) that recognise
what sort of object is being referenced. So, for example, the
label for a \section would be expected to be of the form
'sec:foo': the package would recognise the 'sec:' part.",应用

environments (showing both result and verbatim source).",应用
texlive-filecontents,应用, Extended filecontents and filecontents* environments," LaTeX2e's filecontents and filecontents* environments enable a
LaTeX source file to generate external files as it runs through
LaTeX. However, there are two limitations of these
environments: they refuse to overwrite existing files, and they
can only be used in the preamble of a document. The
filecontents package removes these limitations, letting you
overwrite existing files and letting you use
filecontents/filecontents* anywhere.",应用
texlive-filehook,应用, Hooks for input files," The package provides several file hooks (AtBegin, AtEnd, ...)
for files read by \input, \include and \InputIfFileExists.
General hooks for all such files (e.g. all \include'd ones) and
file specific hooks only used for named files are provided; two
hooks are provided for the end of \included files -- one
before, and one after the final \clearpage.",应用
texlive-finstrut,应用, Adjust behaviour of the ends of footnotes," The LaTeX internal command \@finalstrut is used automatically
used at the end of footnote texts to insert a strut to avoid
mis-spacing of multiple footnotes. Unfortunately the command
can cause a blank line at the end of a footnote. The package
provides a solution to this problem.",应用

texlive-footmisc,应用, A range of footnote options," A collection of ways to change the typesetting of footnotes.
The package provides means of changing the layout of the
footnotes themselves (including setting them in 'paragraphs' --
the para option), a way to number footnotes per page (the
perpage option), to make footnotes disappear when an argument
moves (stable option) and to deal with multiple references to
footnotes from the same place (multiple option). The package
also has a range of techniques for labelling footnotes with
symbols rather than numbers. Some of the functions of the
package are overlap with the functionality of other packages.
The para option is also provided by the manyfoot and bigfoot
packages, though those are both also portmanteau packages.
(Don't be seduced by fnpara, whose implementation is improved
by the present package.) The perpage option is also offered by
footnpag and by the rather more general-purpose perpage",应用
texlive-glyphlist,应用, glyphlist package, glyphlist package,应用
texlive-graphics,应用, Standard LaTeX graphics," The package was designed to accommodate all needs for inclusion
of graphics in LaTeX documents, replacing many earlier packages
used in LaTeX 2.09. The package aims to give a consistent
interface to including the file types that are understood in
your output, by use of 'printer drivers' (now known, simply, as
'drivers'). The distribtion of the package contains several
drivers, but others (for example, pdfTeX) are distributed
separately. The package also offers several means of
manipulating graphics in the course of inserting them into a
document (for example, rotation and scaling). For extended
documentation see epslatex. The package is part of the graphics
bundle, which is one of the collections in the LaTeX 'required'
set of packages.",应用
texlive-graphics-def,应用, Colour and graphics option files," This bundle is a combined distribution consisting of dvips.def,
pdftex.def, luatex.def, xetex.def, dvipdfmx.def, and
dvisvgm.def driver option files for the LaTeX graphics and

texlive-hyphenat,应用, Disable/enable hypenation," This package can disable all hyphenation or enable hyphenation
of non-alphabetics or monospaced fonts. The package can also
enable hyphenation within 'words' that contain non-alphabetic
characters (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of
text typeset in monospaced (e.g., cmtt) fonts.",应用
texlive-hyph-utf8,应用, Hyphenation patterns expressed in UTF-8," Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need
hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems
require hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font
in use (such encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with
names like OT1, T2A, TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package
offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-
8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in
older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style
TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the
UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant
the older patterns.",应用
texlive-ifetex,应用, Provides \ifetex switch," The package provides the switch \ifetex which indicates whether
e-TeX is available or not. The package can be loaded as LaTeX
package using \usepackage{ifetex} or in plain TeX using \input

versatility. There is also a letter class, different from all
other letter classes. It also offers e.g. a package for
calculated type areas in the way laid down by the typographer
Jan Tschichold, a package for easily changing and defining of
page styles, a package for getting not only the current date
but also the name of day and a package for getting current
time. All these packages may be used not only with KOMA-Script
classes but also with standard classes. Since every package has
its own version number, the number below is only the version of

texlive-latex,应用, A TeX macro package that defines LaTeX," LaTeX is a widely-used macro package for TeX, providing many
basic document formating commands extended by a wide range of
packages. It is a development of Leslie Lamport's original
LaTeX 2.09, and superseded the older system in June 1994. The
basic distribution is catalogued separately, at latex-base;
apart from a large set of contributed packages and third-party
documentation (elsewhere on the archive), the distribution
includes: - a bunch of required packages, which LaTeX authors

texlive-lualatex-math,应用, Fixes for mathematics-related LuaLaTeX issues," The package patches a few commands of the LaTeX2e kernel and
the amsmath and mathtools packages to be more compatible with
the LuaTeX engine. It is only meaningful for LuaLaTeX documents
containing mathematical formulas, and does not exhibit any new
functionality. The fixes are mostly moved from the unicode-math

texlive-mathtools,应用, Mathematical tools to use with amsmath," Mathtools provides a series of packages designed to enhance the
appearance of documents containing a lot of mathematics. The
main backbone is amsmath, so those unfamiliar with this
required part of the LaTeX system will probably not find the

remaining coverage is available from the MinionPro font with
the MinionPro package. The fonts are available in both MetaFont
and Adobe Type 1 formats, and a comprehensive support package
is provided. While the fonts were designed to fit with Minon
Pro, the design should fit well with other renaissance or
baroque faces: indeed, it will probably work with most fonts
that are neither too wide nor too thin, for example Palatino or
Times; it is known to look good with Sabon. There is no package
designed to configure its use with any font other than Minion
Pro, but (for example) simply loading mnsymbol after mathpazo

construction, properly aligned, scaled, and/or rotated.",应用
texlive-psnfss,应用, Font support for common PostScript fonts," Font definition files, macros and font metrics for freely-
available Adobe Type 1 fonts. The font set consists of the
'LaserWriter 35' set (originally 'freely available' because
embedded in PostScript printers), and a variety of other free
fonts, together with some additions. Note that while many of
the fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers,
most publishers require fonts embedded in documents, which
requires that you have the fonts in your TeX system.
Fortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from URW
(available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts
covered by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica,
New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf
Dingbats. In addition, the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe
Utopia are covered (those fonts were contributed to the Public
Domain by their commercial foundries). Separate packages are
provided to load each font for use as main text font. The
packages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its
size scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as
a Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides
the means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are
tailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics
are covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable
mathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some
glyphs from Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally
extended with the fpl small-caps and old-style figures fonts)
which uses Palatino as base font, with the mathpazo fonts. The

Also (oddly) cos and sin use arguments in degrees. Pst-math
provides all those operators in a header file pst-math.pro with
wrappers pst-math.sty and pst-math.tex. In addition, sinc,
gauss, gammaln and bessel are implemented (only partially for
the latter). pst-math is designed essentially to work with pst-

configurable (La)TeX-based authoring system for hypertext.
Tex4ht does not parse (La)TeX source (so that it avoids the
difficulties encountered by many other converters, arising from
the irregularity of (La)TeX syntax). Instead, Tex4ht uses
(La)TeX itself (with an extra macro package) to produce a non-
standard DVI file that it can then process. This technique
allows TeX4ht to approach the robustness characteristic of
restricted-syntax systems such as hyperlatex and gellmu. Note
that CTAN no longer holds the definitive sources of the

closing single quotes. Other fonts, and most programming
languages, print ` as a grave accent and ' upright; ' is used
both to open and to close quoted strings. The package switches
the typewriter font to Computer Modern Typewriter in OT1
encoding, and modifies the behaviour of verbatim, verbatim*,
\verb, and \verb* to print in the ""` and ' way"". It does
thisregardless of other fonts or encodings in use, so long as
the package is loaded after the other fonts were. The package
does not affect \tt, \texttt, etc.",应用
texlive-url,应用, Verbatim with URL-sensitive line breaks," The command \url is a form of verbatim command that allows
linebreaks at certain characters or combinations of characters,
accepts reconfiguration, and can usually be used in the
argument to another command. (The \urldef command provides
robust commands that serve in cases when \url doesn't work in
an argument.) The command is intended for email addresses,
hypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which normally have
no spaces, so by default the package ignores spaces in its
argument. However, a package option ""allows spaces"", which is
useful for operating systems where spaces are a common part of
file names.",应用

fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family. This new version of
Xerces introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for
building parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and
easy to program.

The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI but other
parser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces
Native Interface. For complete design and implementation documents, refer to
the XNI Manual.

Xerces2 is a fully conforming XML Schema processor. For more information,
refer to the XML Schema page.

Xerces2 also provides a complete implementation of the Document Object Model
Level 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations and provides a complete
implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C Recommendation. It also
provides support for OASIS XML Catalogs v1.1.

Xerces2 is able to parse documents written according to the XML 1.1
Recommendation, except that it does not yet provide an option to enable
normalization checking as described in section 2.13 of this specification. It
also handles name spaces according to the XML Namespaces 1.1 Recommendation,

xfsdump,系统,Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem ,"The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of

storage medium.	 It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are ""endian safe"" and can
thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
and also between IRIX machines.

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups. ",应用
