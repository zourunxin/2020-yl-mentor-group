libcmocka,应用,系统, Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C," There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

This is the successor of Google's Cmockery."

libxcrypt,核心,系统,"Extended crypt library for DES, MD5, Blowfish and others ","libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based password
hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt. "

intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
