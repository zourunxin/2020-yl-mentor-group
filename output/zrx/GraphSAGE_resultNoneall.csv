Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results."

enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt. "
