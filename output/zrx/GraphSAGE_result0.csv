functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

memkind without user extension include control of NUMA and page size
features. The jemalloc non-standard interface has been extended to
enable specialized arenas to make requests for virtual memory from the
operating system through the memkind partition interface. Through the
other memkind interfaces the user can control and extend memory
partition features and allocate memory while selecting enabled
features. This software is being made available for early evaluation.
Feedback on design or implementation is greatly appreciated."

SCons ""configuration files"" are Python scripts, eliminating the need
to learn a new build tool syntax. SCons maintains a global view of
all dependencies in a tree, and can scan source (or other) files for
implicit dependencies, such as files specified on #include lines. SCons
uses MD5 signatures to rebuild only when the contents of a file have
really changed, not just when the timestamp has been touched. SCons
supports side-by-side variant builds, and is easily extended with user-
defined Builder and/or Scanner objects."
