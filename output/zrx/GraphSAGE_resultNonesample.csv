dwarves,应用,系统, Debugging Information Manipulation Tools (pahole & friends)," dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in
ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as
GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results."

constructs.

The C preprocessor provides four separate functionalities: the
inclusion of header files (files of declarations that can be
substituted into your program); macro expansion (you can define macros,
and the C preprocessor will replace the macros with their definitions
throughout the program); conditional compilation (using special
preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude parts of the
program according to various conditions); and line control (if you use
a program to combine or rearrange source files into an intermediate
file which is then compiled, you can use line control to inform the
compiler about where each source line originated).

You should install this package if you are a C programmer and you use
macros."

libffi,系统,核心,A portable foreign function interface library ,"Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages. "

other utilities for administering XFS filesystems.

xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
storage medium.	 It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are ""endian safe"" and can
thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
and also between IRIX machines.

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups. "
xfsprogs,系统,核心,Utilities for managing the XFS filesystem ,"A set of commands to use the XFS filesystem, including mkfs.xfs.

XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
and scalability.

This implementation is on-disk compatible with the IRIX version
of XFS. "
xinetd,系统,核心, A secure replacement for inetd," Xinetd is a secure replacement for inetd, the Internet services
daemon. Xinetd provides access control for all services based on the
address of the remote host and/or on time of access and can prevent
denial-of-access attacks. Xinetd provides extensive logging, has no
limit on the number of server arguments, and lets you bind specific
services to specific IP addresses on your host machine. Each service
has its own specific configuration file for Xinetd; the files are
located in the /etc/xinetd.d directory."

ypserv,系统,核心, The NIS (Network Information Service) server," The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system that provides
network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group
information) to all of the machines on a network. NIS can allow users
to log in on any machine on the network, as long as the machine has
the NIS client programs running and the user's password is recorded in
the NIS passwd database. NIS was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages
(YP).

This package provides the NIS server, which will need to be running on
your network. NIS clients do not need to be running the server.

Install ypserv if you need an NIS server for your network. You also
need to install the yp-tools and ypbind packages on any NIS client
machines."

zvbi,其它,系统," Raw VBI, Teletext and Closed Caption decoding library"," ZVBI provides functions to capture and decode VBI data. The vertical blanking
interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal that temporarily suspends
transmission of the signal for the electron gun to move back up to the first
line of the television screen to trace the next screen field. The vertical
blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything sent during the VBI
would naturally not be displayed; various test signals, closed captioning, and
other digital data can be sent during this time period."
