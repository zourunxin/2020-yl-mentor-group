libcmocka,应用, Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C," There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

dwarves,应用, Debugging Information Manipulation Tools (pahole & friends)," dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in
ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as
GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results.",应用

environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.

Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.

reason behind the decision to ignore a message, or a detected virus name.

libffi,系统,A portable foreign function interface library ,"Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages. ",系统

preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

perl-Devel-GlobalDestruction,系统," Expose PL_dirty, the flag that marks global destruction"," Perl's global destruction is a little tricky to deal with with respect to
finalizers because it's not ordered and objects can sometimes disappear.

Writing defensive destructors is hard and annoying, and usually if global
destruction is happening you only need the destructors that free up non
process local resources to actually execute.

For these constructors you can avoid the mess by simply bailing out if
global destruction is in effect.",系统
perl-Digest-CRC,系统, Generic CRC functions," The Digest::CRC module calculates CRC sums of all sorts. It contains wrapper
functions with the correct parameters for CRC-CCITT, CRC-16 and CRC-32.",系统
perl-Digest-HMAC,系统, Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication," HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that
share a secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest
algorithm, usually MD5 or SHA-1. The HMAC mechanism is described in
RFC 2104.

HMAC follow the common Digest:: interface, but the constructor takes
the secret key and the name of some other simple Digest:: as argument.",系统
perl-Dist-CheckConflicts,系统, Declare version conflicts for your dist," One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This module
attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to specify conflicting
versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the module is done
installing.

For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo. If
Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause
Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend on
the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency
(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intent
properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be for
there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would
let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existing
module is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to do
this manually.",系统
perl-encoding,系统, Write your Perl script in non-ASCII or non-UTF-8," With the encoding pragma, you can write your Perl script in any encoding you
like (so long as the Encode module supports it) and still enjoy Unicode
support.

However, this encoding module is deprecated under perl 5.18. It uses
a mechanism provided by perl that is deprecated under 5.18 and higher, and may
be removed in a future version.

The easiest and the best alternative is to write your script in UTF-8.",系统
perl-Env,系统, Perl module that imports environment variables as scalars or arrays," Perl maintains environment variables in a special hash named %ENV. For when
this access method is inconvenient, the Perl module Env allows environment

perl-Error,系统, Error/exception handling in an OO-ish way," The Error package provides two interfaces. Firstly Error provides a
procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly Error is a base class
for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or
can simply be recorded.",系统
perl-Eval-Closure,系统, Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval," String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses
it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which
speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without
its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly).",系统
perl-Exporter,系统, Implements default import method for modules," The Exporter module implements an import method which allows a module to

perl-File-chdir,系统, A more sensible way to change directories," Perl's chdir() has the unfortunate problem of being very, very, very
global. If any part of your program calls chdir() or if any library you

pmix,应用, Process Management Interface Exascale (PMIx)," The Process Management Interface (PMI) has been used for quite some time as

PMI-1 predecessor, attaining rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M
processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations remains
challenging.

PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by
providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to
support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of
the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in
fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but
rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference

offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-
8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in

in maths mode is not affected.",应用
texlive-upquote,应用," Show ""realistic"" quotes in verbatim"," Typewriter-style fonts are best for program listings, but
Computer Modern Typewriter prints ` and ' as bent opening and
closing single quotes. Other fonts, and most programming
languages, print ` as a grave accent and ' upright; ' is used
both to open and to close quoted strings. The package switches
the typewriter font to Computer Modern Typewriter in OT1
encoding, and modifies the behaviour of verbatim, verbatim*,
\verb, and \verb* to print in the ""` and ' way"". It does
thisregardless of other fonts or encodings in use, so long as

non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:

ypserv,系统, The NIS (Network Information Service) server," The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system that provides
network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group
information) to all of the machines on a network. NIS can allow users
to log in on any machine on the network, as long as the machine has
the NIS client programs running and the user's password is recorded in
the NIS passwd database. NIS was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages
(YP).

This package provides the NIS server, which will need to be running on
your network. NIS clients do not need to be running the server.
