OpenGL and is designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that
can render without stepping on each others toes.

As well aiming for a nice API, we think having a single library as opposed
to an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being
able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility
APIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented
once and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.

Having other backends, besides OpenGL, such as drm, Gallium or D3D are
options we are interested in for the future.",应用

dwarves,应用, Debugging Information Manipulation Tools (pahole & friends)," dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in

GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

sure they produce the same results.",系统

throughout the program); conditional compilation (using special
preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude parts of the
program according to various conditions); and line control (if you use

file which is then compiled, you can use line control to inform the
compiler about where each source line originated).

textual regedit format.

'hivexml' can be used to convert a hive file to a more useful XML
format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.

libxcrypt,核心,"Extended crypt library for DES, MD5, Blowfish and others ","libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based password
hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt. ",应用

perl-Net-DNS,系统, DNS resolver modules for Perl," Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules that act as a Domain Name System
(DNS) resolver. It allows the programmer to perform DNS queries that are
beyond the capabilities of gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.

The programmer should be somewhat familiar with the format of a DNS packet and
its various sections. See RFC 1035 or DNS and BIND (Albitz & Liu) for details.",系统
perl-Net-SMTP-SSL,系统, SSL support for Net::SMTP," Implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL for its
network operations.",系统
perl-Package-Stash-XS,系统, Faster and more correct implementation of the Package::Stash API," This is a back-end for Package::Stash, which provides the functionality in a
way that's less buggy and much faster. It will be used by default if it's
installed, and should be preferred in all environments with a compiler.",系统
perl-Parse-PMFile,系统, Parses .pm file as PAUSE does," The most of the code of this module is taken from the PAUSE code as of
April 2013 almost verbatim. Thus, the heart of this module should be quite
stable. However, I made it not to use pipe (""-|"") as well as I stripped
database-related code. If you encounter any issue, that's most probably
because of my modification.",系统
perl-Path-Tiny,系统, File path utility," This module attempts to provide a small, fast utility for working with file
paths. It is friendlier to use than File::Spec and provides easy access to
functions from several other core file handling modules.

It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as IO::All or Path::Class, nor does
it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32 platforms. Even then, it
might break if you try something particularly obscure or tortuous.

All paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes. Stringifying the
object gives you back the path (after some clean up).

File input/output methods flock handles before reading or writing, as
appropriate.

The *_utf8 methods (slurp_utf8, lines_utf8, etc.) operate in raw mode without
CRLF translation.",系统
perl-Pod-Coverage,系统, Checks if the documentation of a module is comprehensive," Developers hate writing documentation.  They'd hate it even more if their
computer tattled on them, but maybe they'll be even more thankful in the
long run.  Even if not, perlmodstyle tells you to, so you must obey.

This module provides a mechanism for determining if the pod for a given
module is comprehensive.",系统
perl-Pod-Escapes,系统, Resolve POD escape sequences, This module provides things that are useful in decoding Pod E<...> sequences.,系统
perl-Pod-LaTeX,系统, Convert POD data to formatted LaTeX," Pod::LaTeX is a module to convert documentation in the POD format into

The SNMP operations currently supported are ""get"", ""get-next"", ""get-bulk""
and ""set"", as well as trap generation and reception.",系统
perl-Socket,系统, Networking constants and support functions," This Perl module provides a variety of constants, structure manipulators and
other functions related to socket-based networking. The values and functions
provided are useful when used in conjunction with Perl core functions such as
socket(), setsockopt() and bind(). It also provides several other support
functions, mostly for dealing with conversions of network addresses between
human-readable and native binary forms, and for hostname resolver operations.",系统
perl-Specio,系统, Type constraints and coercions for Perl," The Specio distribution provides classes for representing type constraints
and coercion, along with syntax sugar for declaring them.

Note that this is not a proper type system for Perl. Nothing in this
distribution will magically make the Perl interpreter start checking a value's
type on assignment to a variable. In fact, there's no built-in way to apply a
type to a variable at all.

Instead, you can explicitly check a value against a type, and optionally coerce
values to that type.",系统
perl-String-CRC32,系统, Perl interface for cyclic redundancy check generation," This packages provides a perl module to generate checksums from strings and
from files.

The checksums are the same as those calculated by ZMODEM, PKZIP, PICCHECK and
many others.

There's another perl module called String::CRC, which supports calculation of
CRC values of various widths (i.e. not just 32 bits), but the generated sums
differ from those of the programs mentioned above.",系统
perl-Sub-Exporter,系统, Sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines," Sub::Exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to Exporter.pm. It allows
for renaming, currying/sub-generation, and other cool stuff.

ACHTUNG! If you're not familiar with Exporter or exporting, read
Sub::Exporter::Tutorial first!",系统
perl-Sub-Identify,系统, Retrieve names of code references," Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
this, it uses Perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.",系统
perl-Switch,系统, A switch statement for Perl," Switch.pm provides the syntax and semantics for an explicit case mechanism for
Perl. The syntax is minimal, introducing only the keywords C<switch> and
C<case> and conforming to the general pattern of existing Perl control
structures. The semantics are particularly rich, allowing any one (or more) of
nearly 30 forms of matching to be used when comparing a switch value with its
various cases.",系统
perl-Sys-MemInfo,系统,Memory information as Perl module ,"Sys::MemInfo returns the total amount of free and used physical memory in
bytes in totalmem and freemem variables. ",系统
perl-Sys-Virt,系统, Represent and manage a libvirt hypervisor connection," The Sys::Virt module provides a Perl XS binding to the libvirt virtual
machine management APIs. This allows machines running within arbitrary
virtualization containers to be managed with a consistent API.",系统
perl-Test-Deep,系统, Extremely flexible deep comparison," Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result you
got is the result you were expecting. At its simplest it compares two
structures by going through each level, ensuring that the values
match, that arrays and hashes have the same elements and that
references are blessed into the correct class. It also handles
circular data structures without getting caught in an infinite loop.",系统
perl-Test-Differences,系统, Test strings and data structures and show differences if not OK," When the code you're testing returns multiple lines, records or data
structures and they're just plain wrong, an equivalent to the Unix
diff utility may be just what's needed.",系统
perl-Test-Harness,系统, Run Perl standard test scripts with statistics," This package allows tests to be run and results automatically aggregated and
output to STDOUT.

Although, for historical reasons, the Test-Harness distribution takes its name
from this module it now exists only to provide TAP::Harness with an interface
that is somewhat backwards compatible with Test::Harness 2.xx. If you're
writing new code consider using TAP::Harness directly instead.",系统
perl-Test-NoWarnings,系统, Make sure you didn't emit any warnings while testing," In general, your tests shouldn't produce warnings. This module causes any
warnings to be captured and stored. It automatically adds an extra test
that will run when your script ends to check that there were no warnings.
If there were any warnings, the test will give a ""not ok"" and diagnostics of
where, when and what the warning was, including a stack trace of what was
going on when the it occurred.",系统
perl-Test-Warn,系统, Perl extension to test methods for warnings," This module provides a few convenience methods for testing warning
based code.",系统
perl-Test-Warnings,系统, Test for warnings and the lack of them," If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan.",系统
perl-Text-Diff,系统, Perform diffs on files and record sets," Text::Diff provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff utility.
It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is better
integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster
than shelling out to a system's diff executable for small files, and
generally slower on larger files.",系统
perl-Text-ParseWords,系统, Parse text into an array of tokens or array of arrays," The nested_quotewords() and quotewords() functions accept a delimiter (which
can be a regular expression) and a list of lines and then breaks those lines
up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear inside quotes.
quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single long list, while
nested_quotewords() returns a list of token lists corresponding to the
elements of @lines. parse_line() does tokenizing on a single string. The
quotewords() functions simply call &parse_line(), so if you're only splitting
one line you can call parse_line() directly and save a function call.",系统
perl-Text-Tabs+Wrap,系统, Expand tabs and do simple line wrapping," Text::Tabs performs the same job that the UNIX expand(1) and unexpand(1)
commands do: adding or removing tabs from a document.

Text::Wrap::wrap() will reformat lines into paragraphs. All it does is break
up long lines, it will not join short lines together.",系统
perl-Text-Unidecode,系统, US-ASCII transliterations of Unicode text," 
Text::Unidecode provides a function, `unidecode(...)' that takes
Unicode data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F). The
representation is almost always an attempt at *transliteration* -- i.e.,
conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
some other writing system.",系统
perl-Text-WrapI18N,系统, Line wrapping with support for several locale setups," This is a module which intends to substitute Text::Wrap,
which supports internationalized texts including:
 - multi-byte encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5,
 - full width characters like east Asian characters which appear in
   UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, Big5, and so on,
 - combining characters like diacritical marks which appear in UTF-8,
   ISO-8859-11 (aka TIS-620), and so on, and
 - languages which don't use white spaces between words, like Chinese
   and Japanese.",系统
perl-threads,系统, Perl interpreter-based threads," Since Perl 5.8, thread programming has been available using a model called
interpreter threads which provides a new Perl interpreter for each thread,
and, by default, results in no data or state information being shared
between threads.

(Prior to Perl 5.8, 5005threads was available through the ""Thread.pm"" API.
This threading model has been deprecated, and was removed as of Perl 5.10.0.)",系统
perl-Variable-Magic,系统, Associate user-defined magic to variables from Perl," Magic is Perl way of enhancing objects. This mechanism let the user add
extra data to any variable and hook syntactical operations (such as access,
assignation or destruction) that can be applied to it. With this module,
you can add your own magic to any variable without the pain of the C API.",系统

by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very

texlive-enumitem,应用," Control layout of itemize, enumerate, description"," This package provides user control over the layout of the three
basic list environments: enumerate, itemize and description. It
supersedes both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well-
structured replacements for all their funtionality), and in
addition provides functions to compute the layout of labels,
and to 'clone' the standard environments, to create new
environments with counters of their own.",应用
texlive-environ,应用, A new interface for environments in LaTeX," The package provides the \collect@body command (as in amsmath),
as well as a \long version \Collect@Body, for collecting the
body text of an environment. These commands are used to define
a new author interface to creating new environments. For
example: \NewEnviron{test} wraps the entire environment body in
square brackets, doing the right thing in ignoring leading and
trailing spaces.",应用
texlive-epstopdf,应用, Convert EPS to 'encapsulated' PDF using Ghostscript," Epstopdf is a Perl script that converts an EPS file to an
'encapsulated' PDF file (a single page file whose media box is
the same as the original EPS's bounding box). The resulting
file suitable for inclusion by PDFTeX as an image. The script
is adapted to run both on Windows and on Unix-alike systems.
The script makes use of Ghostscript for the actual conversion
to PDF. It assumes Ghostscript version 6.51 or later, and (by
default) suppresses its automatic rotation of pages where most
of the text is not horizontal. LaTeX users may make use of the
epstopdf package, which will run the epstopdf script ""on the
fly"", thus giving the illusion that PDFLaTeX is accepting EPS
graphic files.",应用
texlive-etex,应用," An extended version of TeX, from the NTS project"," An extended version of TeX (which is capable of running as if
it were TeX unmodified). E-TeX has been specified by the LaTeX
team as the engine for the development of LaTeX, in the
immediate future; as a result, LaTeX programmers may (in all
current TeX distributions) assume e-TeX functionality.",应用
texlive-euler,应用, Use AMS Euler fonts for math," Provides a setup for using the AMS Euler family of fonts for
mathematics in LaTeX documents. ""The underlying philosophy of
Zapf's Euler design was to capture the flavour of mathematics
as it might be written by a mathematician with excellent
handwriting."" [concrete-tug] The euler package is based on
Knuth's macros for the book 'Concrete Mathematics'. The text
fonts for the Concrete book are supported by the beton package.",应用
texlive-euro,应用, Provide Euro values for national currency amounts," Converts arbitrary national currency amounts using the Euro as
base unit, and typesets monetary amounts in almost any desired
way. Write, e.g., \ATS{17.6} to get something like '17,60 oS
(1,28 Euro)' automatically. Conversion rates for the initial
Euro-zone countries are already built-in. Further rates can be
added easily. The package uses the fp package to do its sums.",应用
texlive-filecontents,应用, Extended filecontents and filecontents* environments," LaTeX2e's filecontents and filecontents* environments enable a
LaTeX source file to generate external files as it runs through
LaTeX. However, there are two limitations of these
environments: they refuse to overwrite existing files, and they
can only be used in the preamble of a document. The
filecontents package removes these limitations, letting you
overwrite existing files and letting you use
filecontents/filecontents* anywhere.",应用
texlive-fix2col,应用, Fix miscellaneous two column mode features," Fix mark handling so that \firstmark is taken from the first
column if that column has any marks at all; keep two column
floats like figure* in sequence with single column floats like
figure.",应用
texlive-float,应用, Improved interface for floating objects," Improves the interface for defining floating objects such as
figures and tables. Introduces the boxed float, the ruled float
and the plaintop float. You can define your own floats and
improve the behaviour of the old ones. The package also
provides the H float modifier option of the obsolete here
package. You can select this as automatic default with
\floatplacement{figure}{H}.",应用
texlive-fonts-tlwg,应用, Thai fonts for LaTeX from TLWG," A collection of free Thai fonts, supplied as FontForge sources,
and with LaTeX .fd files. This package depends on the thailatex
package.",应用
texlive-fontware,应用, fontware package, fontware package,应用
texlive-footmisc,应用, A range of footnote options," A collection of ways to change the typesetting of footnotes.
The package provides means of changing the layout of the
footnotes themselves (including setting them in 'paragraphs' --
the para option), a way to number footnotes per page (the
perpage option), to make footnotes disappear when an argument
moves (stable option) and to deal with multiple references to
footnotes from the same place (multiple option). The package
also has a range of techniques for labelling footnotes with
symbols rather than numbers. Some of the functions of the
package are overlap with the functionality of other packages.
The para option is also provided by the manyfoot and bigfoot
packages, though those are both also portmanteau packages.
(Don't be seduced by fnpara, whose implementation is improved
by the present package.) The perpage option is also offered by
footnpag and by the rather more general-purpose perpage",应用
texlive-garuda-c90,应用, TeX support (from CJK) for the garuda font, garuda-c90 package,应用
texlive-geometry,应用, Flexible and complete interface to document dimensions," The package provides an easy and flexible user interface to
customize page layout, implementing auto-centering and auto-
balancing mechanisms so that the users have only to give the
least description for the page layout. For example, if you want
to set each margin 2cm without header space, what you need is
just \usepackage[margin=2cm,nohead]{geometry}. The package
knows about all the standard paper sizes, so that the user need
not know what the nominal 'real' dimensions of the paper are,
just its standard name (such as a4, letter, etc.). An important
feature is the package's ability to communicate the paper size
it's set up to the output (whether via DVI \specials or via
direct interaction with PDF(La)TeX).",应用
texlive-graphics-def,应用, Colour and graphics option files," This bundle is a combined distribution consisting of dvips.def,
pdftex.def, luatex.def, xetex.def, dvipdfmx.def, and
dvisvgm.def driver option files for the LaTeX graphics and
color packages. It is hoped that by combining their source
repositories at https://github.com/latex3/graphics-def it will
be easier to coordinate updates.",应用

MetaPost.",应用
texlive-l3kernel,应用, LaTeX3 programming conventions," The l3kernel bundle provides an implementation of the LaTeX3
programmers' interface, as a set of packages that run under
LaTeX 2e. The interface provides the foundation on which the
LaTeX3 kernel and other future code are built: it is an API for
TeX programmers. The packages are set up so that the LaTeX3
conventions can be used with regular LaTeX 2e packages. All the
files of the bundle are also available in the Subversion (SVN)
repository of the LaTeX3 Project.",应用
texlive-latex2man,应用, Translate LaTeX-based manual pages into Unix man format," A tool to translate UNIX manual pages written with LaTeX into a
man-page format understood by the Unix man(1) command.

package loads all the above in one fell swoop.",应用
texlive-manfnt-font,应用, manfnt-font package, manfnt-font package,应用
texlive-mathpazo,应用, Fonts to typeset mathematics to match Palatino," The Pazo Math fonts are a family of PostScript fonts suitable
for typesetting mathematics in combination with the Palatino
family of text fonts. The Pazo Math family is made up of five
fonts provided in Adobe Type 1 format (PazoMath, PazoMath-
Italic, PazoMath-Bold, PazoMath-BoldItalic, and
PazoMathBlackboardBold). These contain, in designs that match
Palatino, glyphs that are usually not available in Palatino and
for which Computer Modern looks odd when combined with
Palatino. These glyphs include the uppercase Greek alphabet in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, the
lowercase Greek alphabet in slanted shape in regular and bold
weights, several mathematical glyphs (partialdiff, summation,
product, coproduct, emptyset, infinity, and proportional) in
regular and bold weights, other glyphs (Euro and dotlessj) in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, and the
uppercase letters commonly used to represent various number
sets (C, I, N, Q, R, and Z) in blackboard bold. The set also
includes a set of 'true' small-caps fonts, also suitable for
use with Palatino (or one of its clones). LaTeX macro support
(using package mathpazo.sty) is provided in psnfss (a required
part of any LaTeX distribution).",应用
texlive-memoir,应用," Typeset fiction, non-fiction and mathematical books"," The memoir class is for typesetting poetry, fiction, non-
fiction, and mathematical works. Permissible document 'base'
font sizes range from 9 to 60pt. There is a range of page-
styles and well over a dozen chapter-styles to choose from, as
well as methods for specifying your own layouts and designs.
The class also provides the functionality of over thirty of the
more popular packages, thus simplifying document sources. The
class automatically loads an associated patch file mempatch;
the patch file may be updated from time to time, between
releases of the class itself. (The patch file stays around even
when there are no extant patches.) Users who wish to use the
hyperref package, in a document written with the memoir class,
should also use the memhfixc package (part of this bundle).
Note, however, that current versions of hyperref actually load
the package automatically if they detect that they are running
under memoir.",应用
texlive-metapost,应用, A development of Metafont for creating graphics," MetaPost uses a language based on that of Metafont to produce
precise technical illustrations. Its output is scalable
PostScript or SVG, rather than the bitmaps Metafont creates.",应用
texlive-mptopdf,应用," mpost to PDF, native MetaPost graphics inclusion"," The mptopdf script does standalone conversion from mpost to
PDF, using the supp-* and syst-* files.  They also allow native
MetaPost graphics inclusion in LaTeX (via pdftex.def) and
ConTeXt.  They can be used independently of the rest of
ConTeXt, yet are maintained as part of it.  So in TeX Live we
pull them out to this separate package for the benefit of LaTeX
users who do not install the rest of ConTeXt.  This can be
found on CTAN in macros/pdftex/graphics.",应用
texlive-needspace,应用, Insert pagebreak if not enough space," Provides commands to disable pagebreaking within a given
vertical space. If there is not enough space between the
command and the bottom of the page, a new page will be started.",应用
texlive-norasi-c90,应用, TeX support (from CJK) for the norasi font in thailatex, norasi-c90 package,应用
texlive-pdfpages,应用, Include PDF documents in LaTeX," This package simplifies the inclusion of external multi-page
PDF documents in LaTeX documents. Pages may be freely selected
and similar to psnup it is possible to put several logical
pages onto each sheet of paper. Furthermore a lot of hypertext
features like hyperlinks and article threads are provided. The
package supports pdfTeX (pdflatex) and VTeX. With VTeX it is
even possible to use this package to insert PostScript files,
in addition to PDF files.",应用
texlive-polyglossia,应用, Modern multilingual typesetting with XeLaTeX," This package provides a complete Babel replacement for users of
XeLaTeX; it relies on the fontspec package, version 2.0 at
least. The current release offers support of 68 languages.",应用
texlive-preprint,应用," A bundle of packages provided ""as is"""," The bundle comprises: - authblk, which permits footnote style
author/affiliation input in the \author command, - balance, to
balance the end of \twocolumn pages, - figcaps, to send figure
captions, etc., to end document, - fullpage, to set narrow page
margins and set a fixed page style, and - sublabel, which
permits counters to be subnumbered.",应用
texlive-pslatex,应用, Use PostScript fonts by default," A small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard'
PostScript fonts. It is basically a merger of the times and the
(obsolete) mathptm packages from the psnfss suite. You must
have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts
to use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex
package tries to compensate for the visual differences between
the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing'
Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is
supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that
allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without
needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a
different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available
now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,
pslatex is widely considered obsolete.",应用
texlive-pspicture,应用, PostScript picture support," A replacement for LaTeX's picture macros, that uses PostScript
\special commands. The package is now largely superseded by
pict2e.",应用
texlive-pst-blur,应用," PSTricks package for ""blurred"" shadows"," Pst-blur is a package built for use with PSTricks. It provides
macros that apply blurring to the normal shadow function of

texlive-pstricks-add,应用, A collection of add-ons and bugfixes for PSTricks," Collects together examples that have been posted to the
pstricks mailing list, together with many additional features
for the basic pstricks, pst-plot and pst-node, including: -
bugfixes; - new options for the pspicture environment; -
arrows; - braces as node connection/linestyle; - extended axes
for plots (e.g., logarithm axes); - polar plots; - plotting
tangent lines of curves or functions; - solving and printing
differential equationd; - box plots; - matrix plots; and - pie
charts. The package makes use of PostScript routines provided
by pst-math.",应用

texlive-qstest,应用, Bundle for unit tests and pattern matching," This is the public release of the qstest bundle (written for
DocScape Publisher) (C) 2006, 2007 QuinScape GmbH. The bundle
contains the packages 'makematch' for matching patterns to
targets (with a generalization in the form of pattern lists and
keyword lists), and 'qstest' for performing unit tests,
allowing the user to run a number of logged tests ensuring the
consistency of values, properties and call sequences during
execution of test code. Both packages make extensive use of in
their package documentation, providing illustrated examples
that are automatically verified to work as expected. Check the
README file for details.",应用
texlive-seminar,应用, Make overhead slides," A class that produces overhead slides (transparencies), with
many facilities. The class requires availability of the
fancybox package. Seminar is also the basis of other classes,
such as prosper. In fact, seminar is not nowadays reckoned a
good basis for a presentation -- users are advised to use more
recent classes such as powerdot or beamer, both of which are
tuned to 21st-century presentation styles. Note that the
seminar distribution relies on the xcomment package, which was
once part of the bundle, but now has a separate existence.",应用
texlive-setspace,应用, Set space between lines," Provides support for setting the spacing between lines in a
document. Package options include singlespacing,
onehalfspacing, and doublespacing. Alternatively the spacing
can be changed as required with the \singlespacing,
\onehalfspacing, and \doublespacing commands. Other size
spacings also available.",应用
texlive-t2,应用, Support for using T2 encoding," The T2 bundle provides a variety of separate support functions,
for using Cyrillic characters in LaTeX: - the mathtext package,
for using Cyrillic letters 'transparently' in formulae - the
citehack package, for using Cyrillic (or indeed any non-ascii)
characters in citation keys; - support for Cyrillic in BibTeX;
- support for Cyrillic in Makeindex; and - various items of
font support.",应用
texlive-tetex,应用, scripts and files originally written for or included in teTeX," teTeX was a comprehensive distribution of TeX, LaTeX and
family, designed for ease of compilation, installation and
customisation. In 2006, Thomas Esser announced he would no
longer be able to support, or to produce new versions of,
teTeX. With the appearance of TeX live 2007 (whose Unix-system
TeX support originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be
using teTeX at all, in new applications. One of the ""schemes""
available when installing TeX live provides a configuration
very close to that of the old teTeX, but using modern versions
of programs and packages.",应用
texlive-tex4ht,应用, Convert (La)TeX to HTML/XML," A converter from TeX and LaTeX to SGML-based formats such as
(X)HTML, MathML, OpenDocument, and DocBook, providing a
configurable (La)TeX-based authoring system for hypertext.
Tex4ht does not parse (La)TeX source (so that it avoids the
difficulties encountered by many other converters, arising from
the irregularity of (La)TeX syntax). Instead, Tex4ht uses
(La)TeX itself (with an extra macro package) to produce a non-
standard DVI file that it can then process. This technique
allows TeX4ht to approach the robustness characteristic of
restricted-syntax systems such as hyperlatex and gellmu. Note
that CTAN no longer holds the definitive sources of the
package: see the 'Readme' file.",应用
texlive-texconfig,应用, texconfig package," texconfig allows one to configure and maintain TeX in an easy
and convenient manner, offering a series of dialog boxes to
the user. The directory in which texconfig is found is also
preferentially used to find subprograms.",应用
texlive-tex-ini-files,应用, Model TeX format creation files," This bundle provides a collection of model .ini files for
creating TeX formats. These files are commonly used to
introduced distribution-dependent variations in formats. They
are also used to allow existing format source files to be used
with newer engines, for example to adapt the plain e-TeX source
file to work with XeTeX and LuaTeX.",应用

texlive-textpos,应用, Place boxes at arbitrary positions on the LaTeX page," A package to facilitate placement of boxes at absolute
positions on the LaTeX page. There are several reasons why this
might be useful, an important one being to help the creation of
large-format conference posters.",应用
texlive-threeparttable,应用, Tables with captions and notes all the same width," Provides a scheme for tables that have a structured note
section, after the caption. This scheme provides an answer to
the old problem of putting footnotes in tables -- by making
footnotes entirely unnecessary. Note that a threeparttable is
not a float of itself; but you can place it in a table or a
table* environment, if necessary.",应用
texlive-times,应用," URW ""Base 35"" font pack for LaTeX"," A set of fonts for use as ""drop-in"" replacements for Adobe's

texlive-tipa,应用, Fonts and macros for IPA phonetics characters," These fonts are considered the 'ultimate answer' to IPA
typesetting. The encoding of these 8-bit fonts has been
registered as LaTeX standard encoding T3, and the set of
addendum symbols as encoding TS3. 'Times-like' Adobe Type 1
versions are provided for both the T3 and the TS3 fonts.",应用
texlive-titlesec,应用, Select alternative section titles," A package providing an interface to sectioning commands for
selection from various title styles. E.g., marginal titles and
to change the font of all headings with a single command, also
providing simple one-step page styles. Also includes a package
to change the page styles when there are floats in a page. You
may assign headers/footers to individual floats, too.",应用

List of Figures and List of Tables, and the ability to create
new `List of ...'. The ToC \parskip can be changed.",应用
texlive-type1cm,应用, Arbitrary size font selection in LaTeX," LaTeX, by default, restricts the sizes at which you can use its
default computer modern fonts, to a fixed set of discrete sizes
(effectively, a set specified by Knuth). The type1cm package
removes this restriction; this is particularly useful when
using scalable versions of the cm fonts (Bakoma, or the
versions from BSR/Y&Y, or True Type versions from Kinch, PCTeX,
etc.). In fact, since modern distributions will automatically
generate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider
application than just those using scaleable versions of the
fonts. Note that the LaTeX distribution now contains a package
fix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing
the same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts.",应用
texlive-underscore,应用," Control the behaviour of ""_"" in text"," With the package, \_ in text mode (i.e., \textunderscore)
prints an underscore so that hyphenation of words either side
of it is not affected; a package option controls whether an
actual hyphenation point appears after the underscore, or
merely a break point. The package also arranges that, while in
text, '_' itself behaves as \textunderscore (the behaviour of _
in maths mode is not affected.",应用
texlive-unicode-math,应用, Unicode mathematics support for XeTeX and LuaTeX," The current release of this package typesets mathematics with
unicode input and using OpenType maths fonts. (There is little
compatibility with older maths packages.) XeTeX support is well
tested, though LuaTeX support less so. The package can typeset
using STIX fonts, the XITS development of those fonts, the
Asana-Math fonts, the Latin Modern Math, and the TeX Gyre Math
font familiess, as well as the commercial Cambria Math fonts.
There is no support for extra alphabets in the Unicode 'private
use area'. The package relies on recent versions of the
fontspec package and the l3kernel and l3packages bundles.",应用
texlive-unisugar,应用, Define syntactic sugar for Unicode LaTeX," The package allows the user to define shorthand aliases for
single Unicode characters, and also provides support for such
aliases in RTL-text. The package requires an TeX-alike system
that uses Unicode input in a native way: current examples are
XeTeX and LuaTeX.",应用

texlive-xcolor,应用, Driver-independent color extensions for LaTeX and pdfLaTeX," Provides easy driver-independent access to several kinds of
color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colors. It
allows a user to select a document-wide target color model and
offers complete tools for conversion between eight color
models. Additionally, there is a command for alternating row
colors plus repeated non-aligned material (like horizontal
lines) in tables. Colors can be mixed like
\color{red!30!green!40!blue}.",应用
texlive-xecolor,应用, Support for color in XeLaTeX," This is a simple package which defines about 140 different
colours using XeTeX's colour feature. The colours can be used
in bidirectional texts without any problem.",应用
texlive-xecyr,应用, Using Cyrillic languages in XeTeX," Helper tools for using Cyrillic languages with XeLaTeX and
babel.",应用
texlive-xesearch,应用, A string finder for XeTeX," The package finds strings (e.g. (parts of) words or phrases)
and manipulates them (apply any macro), thus turning each word
or phrase into a possible command. It is written in plain XeTeX
and should thus work with any format (it is known to work with
LaTeX and ConTeXt). The main application for the moment is
XeIndex, an automatic index for XeLaTeX, but examples are given
of simple use to check spelling, count words, and highlight
syntax of programming languages.",应用
texlive-xetex-tibetan,应用, XeTeX input maps for Unicode Tibetan," The package provides a map for use with Jonathan Kew's TECkit,
to translate Tibetan to Unicode (range 0F00-0FFF).",应用
texlive-xifthen,应用, Extended conditional commands," This package extends the ifthen package by implementing new
commands to go within the first argument of \ifthenelse: to
test whether a string is void or not, if a command is defined
or equivalent to another. The package also enables use of
complex expressions as introduced by the package calc, together
with the ability of defining new commands to handle complex
tests. The package requires e-TeX features.",应用
texlive-xkeyval,应用, Extension of the keyval package," This package is an extension of the keyval package and offers
additional macros for setting keys and declaring and setting
class or package options. The package allows the programmer to
specify a prefix to the name of the macros it defines for keys,
and to define families of key definitions; these all help use
in documents where several packages define their own sets of
keys.",应用
texlive-xmltex,应用, Support for parsing XML documents," This package provides an implementation of a parser for
documents matching the XML 1.0 and XML Namespace
Recommendations. In addition to parsing commands are provided
to attatch TeX typesetting instructions to the various markup
elemenets as they are encounted. Sample files for typesetting a
subset of TEI, MathML, are included. Element and Attribute
names, as well as character data, may use any characters
allowed in XML, using UTF-8 or a suitable 8-bit encoding.",应用
texlive-xstring,应用, String manipulation for (La)TeX," The package provides macros for manipulating strings -- testing
a string's contents, extracting substrings, substitution of
substrings and providing numbers such as string length,
position of, or number of recurrences of, a substring. The
package works equally in Plain TeX and LaTeX (though e-TeX is
always required). The strings to be processed may contain
(expandable) macros.",应用
