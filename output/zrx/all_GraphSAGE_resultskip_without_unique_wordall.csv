libcmocka,应用, Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C," There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

This is the successor of Google's Cmockery.",应用

can render without stepping on each others toes.

As well aiming for a nice API, we think having a single library as opposed
to an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being
able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility
APIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented
once and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.

environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.

Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire
suite of different applications.

NOTE: You will need to get a new shell after installing this package to
have access to the module alias. ",系统

lato-fonts,其它, A sanserif typeface family," Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
designer _ukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says _ukasz.

Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics.",其它

libxcrypt,核心,"Extended crypt library for DES, MD5, Blowfish and others ","libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based password
hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt. ",应用

objenesis,应用, A library for instantiating Java objects," Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways.",应用

types and encodings. The mapping from file extensions to media types is
defined by the media.types file. If the ~/.media.types file exists it is
used instead. For backwards compatibility we will also look for
~/.mime.types.",系统

perl-Module-Build,系统, Build and install Perl modules," Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
modules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Developers may alter the behavior of the module through sub-classing in a
much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require
a make on your system - most of the Module::Build code is pure-perl and
written in a very cross-platform way. In fact, you don't even need a shell,
so even platforms like MacOS (traditional) can use it fairly easily. Its
only prerequisites are modules that are included with perl 5.6.0, and it
works fine on perl 5.005 if you can install a few additional modules.",系统
perl-Module-Implementation,系统, Loads one of several alternate underlying implementations for a module," This module abstracts out the process of choosing one of several underlying
implementations for a module. This can be used to provide XS and pure Perl
implementations of a module, or it could be used to load an implementation
for a given OS or any other case of needing to provide multiple
implementations.

This module is only useful when you know all the implementations ahead of
time. If you want to load arbitrary implementations then you probably want
something like a plugin system, not this module.",系统
perl-Module-ScanDeps,系统, Recursively scan Perl code for dependencies," This module scans potential modules used by perl programs and returns a

perl-MRO-Compat,系统, Mro::* interface compatibility for Perls < 5.9.5," The ""mro"" namespace provides several utilities for dealing with method
resolution order and method caching in general in Perl 5.9.5 and higher.
This module provides those interfaces for earlier versions of Perl (back
to 5.6.0 anyways).

It is a harmless no-op to use this module on 5.9.5+. That is to say,
code which properly uses MRO::Compat will work unmodified on both older
Perls and 5.9.5+.

If you're writing a piece of software that would like to use the parts
of 5.9.5+'s mro:: interfaces that are supported here, and you want
compatibility with older Perls, this is the module for you.",系统
perl-namespace-clean,系统, Keep your namespace tidy," When you define a function, or import one, into a Perl package, it will
naturally also be available as a method. This does not per se cause
problems, but it can complicate subclassing and, for example, plugin
classes that are included via multiple inheritance by loading them as
base classes.

The 'namespace::clean' pragma will remove all previously declared or
imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle.
Functions called in the package itself will still be bound by their
name, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.",系统
perl-Net-DNS,系统, DNS resolver modules for Perl," Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules that act as a Domain Name System
(DNS) resolver. It allows the programmer to perform DNS queries that are
beyond the capabilities of gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.

The programmer should be somewhat familiar with the format of a DNS packet and
its various sections. See RFC 1035 or DNS and BIND (Albitz & Liu) for details.",系统
perl-Package-Generator,系统, Generate new packages quickly and easily," This module lets you quickly and easily construct new packages. It gives
them unused names and sets up their package data, if provided.",系统
perl-Params-Classify,系统, Argument type classification," This module provides various type-testing functions. These are intended
for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of data they
are operating on. For example, some functions wish to behave
differently depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded
functions in C++).",系统
perl-Params-Validate,系统, Params-Validate Perl module," The Params::Validate module allows you to validate method or function
call parameters to an arbitrary level of specificity. At the simplest
level, it is capable of validating the required parameters were given
and that no unspecified additional parameters were passed in. It is
also capable of determining that a parameter is of a specific type,
that it is an object of a certain class hierarchy, that it possesses
certain methods, or applying validation callbacks to arguments.",系统

perl-Parse-PMFile,系统, Parses .pm file as PAUSE does," The most of the code of this module is taken from the PAUSE code as of
April 2013 almost verbatim. Thus, the heart of this module should be quite
stable. However, I made it not to use pipe (""-|"") as well as I stripped
database-related code. If you encounter any issue, that's most probably
because of my modification.",系统
perl-PathTools,系统," PathTools Perl module (Cwd, File::Spec)", This is the combined distribution for the File::Spec and Cwd modules.,系统
perl-Perl-Destruct-Level,系统, Allows you to change perl's internal destruction level," This module allows you to change perl's internal destruction level. The
default value of the destruct level is 0; it means that perl won't bother
destroying all of its internal data structures and lets the OS do the cleanup
for it at exit.

For perls built with debugging support (-DDEBUGGING), an environment variable
PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL allows you to control the destruction level. This module
enables you to modify it on non-debugging perls too.

Note that some embedded environments might extend the meaning of the
destruction level for their own purposes: mod_perl does that, for example.",系统
perl-PerlIO-utf8_strict,系统, Fast and correct UTF-8 I/O," This module provides a fast and correct UTF-8 PerlIO layer. Unlike perl's

perl-Pod-Markdown,系统, Convert POD to Markdown, This module subclasses Pod::Parser and converts POD to Markdown.,应用
perl-Pod-Plainer,系统, Perl extension for converting Pod to old-style Pod," Pod::Plainer uses Pod::Parser which takes Pod with the (new) 'C<< .. >>'
constructs and returns the old(er) style with just 'C<>'; '<' and '>' are
replaced by 'E<lt>' and 'E<gt>'.
This can be used to pre-process Pod before using tools which do not
recognize the new style Pods.",系统
perl-Role-Tiny,系统, A nouvelle cuisine portion size slice of Moose, Role::Tiny is a minimalist role composition tool.,系统
perl-Scalar-List-Utils,系统, A selection of general-utility scalar and list subroutines," This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be
high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such
that being individual extensions would be wasteful.",系统
perl-Scope-Guard,系统, Lexically scoped resource management," This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of
resource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful when
dealing with exceptions: the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to
a subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the thread of
execution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows lexically-scoped
""promises"" to be made that are automatically honored by perl's garbage
collector.",系统
perl-SGMLSpm,系统, Perl library for parsing the output of nsgmls," Perl programs can use the SGMLSpm module to help convert SGML, HTML or XML
documents into new formats.",系统
perl-Socket,系统, Networking constants and support functions," This Perl module provides a variety of constants, structure manipulators and
other functions related to socket-based networking. The values and functions
provided are useful when used in conjunction with Perl core functions such as
socket(), setsockopt() and bind(). It also provides several other support
functions, mostly for dealing with conversions of network addresses between
human-readable and native binary forms, and for hostname resolver operations.",系统
perl-Specio,系统, Type constraints and coercions for Perl," The Specio distribution provides classes for representing type constraints
and coercion, along with syntax sugar for declaring them.

Note that this is not a proper type system for Perl. Nothing in this
distribution will magically make the Perl interpreter start checking a value's
type on assignment to a variable. In fact, there's no built-in way to apply a
type to a variable at all.

Instead, you can explicitly check a value against a type, and optionally coerce
values to that type.",系统

There's another perl module called String::CRC, which supports calculation of
CRC values of various widths (i.e. not just 32 bits), but the generated sums
differ from those of the programs mentioned above.",系统
perl-Switch,系统, A switch statement for Perl," Switch.pm provides the syntax and semantics for an explicit case mechanism for
Perl. The syntax is minimal, introducing only the keywords C<switch> and
C<case> and conforming to the general pattern of existing Perl control
structures. The semantics are particularly rich, allowing any one (or more) of
nearly 30 forms of matching to be used when comparing a switch value with its
various cases.",系统

perl-Test-Warn,系统, Perl extension to test methods for warnings," This module provides a few convenience methods for testing warning
based code.",系统
perl-Test-Warnings,系统, Test for warnings and the lack of them," If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan.",系统
perl-Text-CharWidth,系统, Get number of occupied columns of a string on terminal," This is a module to provide equivalent feature as wcwidth(3) and

perl-Text-ParseWords,系统, Parse text into an array of tokens or array of arrays," The nested_quotewords() and quotewords() functions accept a delimiter (which
can be a regular expression) and a list of lines and then breaks those lines
up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear inside quotes.
quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single long list, while
nested_quotewords() returns a list of token lists corresponding to the
elements of @lines. parse_line() does tokenizing on a single string. The
quotewords() functions simply call &parse_line(), so if you're only splitting
one line you can call parse_line() directly and save a function call.",系统

a specific way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the
developer. It's most useful for end user applications which should work
on as many server environments as possible (such as blogs, wikis,

texlive-filecontents,应用, Extended filecontents and filecontents* environments," LaTeX2e's filecontents and filecontents* environments enable a
LaTeX source file to generate external files as it runs through
LaTeX. However, there are two limitations of these

texlive-fontspec,应用, Advanced font selection in XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX," Fontspec is a package for XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX. It provides an
automatic and unified interface to feature-rich AAT and
OpenType fonts through the NFSS in LaTeX running on XeTeX or
LuaTeX engines. The package requires the l3kernel and xparse
bundles from the LaTeX 3 development team.",应用
texlive-footmisc,应用, A range of footnote options," A collection of ways to change the typesetting of footnotes.
The package provides means of changing the layout of the
footnotes themselves (including setting them in 'paragraphs' --
the para option), a way to number footnotes per page (the
perpage option), to make footnotes disappear when an argument
moves (stable option) and to deal with multiple references to
footnotes from the same place (multiple option). The package
also has a range of techniques for labelling footnotes with
symbols rather than numbers. Some of the functions of the
package are overlap with the functionality of other packages.
The para option is also provided by the manyfoot and bigfoot
packages, though those are both also portmanteau packages.
(Don't be seduced by fnpara, whose implementation is improved
by the present package.) The perpage option is also offered by
footnpag and by the rather more general-purpose perpage",应用
texlive-gsftopk,应用," Convert ""ghostscript fonts"" to PK files"," Designed for use with xdvi and dvips this utility converts

Y&Y's dviwindo; for PDF control within pdfTeX and dvipdfm; for
TeX4ht; and for VTeX's pdf and HTML backends. The package is
distributed with the backref and nameref packages, which make
use of the facilities of hyperref. The package depends on the
author's kvoptions, ltxcmdsand refcount packages.",应用
texlive-hyph-utf8,应用, Hyphenation patterns expressed in UTF-8," Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need
hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems
require hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font
in use (such encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with
names like OT1, T2A, TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package
offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-
8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in
older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style
TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the
UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant
the older patterns.",应用

Jan Tschichold, a package for easily changing and defining of
page styles, a package for getting not only the current date
but also the name of day and a package for getting current
time. All these packages may be used not only with KOMA-Script
classes but also with standard classes. Since every package has
its own version number, the number below is only the version of
scrbook, scrreprt, scrartcl, scrlttr2 and typearea. These are
the main parts of the bundle.",应用

family of text fonts. The Pazo Math family is made up of five
fonts provided in Adobe Type 1 format (PazoMath, PazoMath-
Italic, PazoMath-Bold, PazoMath-BoldItalic, and
PazoMathBlackboardBold). These contain, in designs that match
Palatino, glyphs that are usually not available in Palatino and
for which Computer Modern looks odd when combined with
Palatino. These glyphs include the uppercase Greek alphabet in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, the
lowercase Greek alphabet in slanted shape in regular and bold
weights, several mathematical glyphs (partialdiff, summation,
product, coproduct, emptyset, infinity, and proportional) in
regular and bold weights, other glyphs (Euro and dotlessj) in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, and the
uppercase letters commonly used to represent various number
sets (C, I, N, Q, R, and Z) in blackboard bold. The set also
includes a set of 'true' small-caps fonts, also suitable for
use with Palatino (or one of its clones). LaTeX macro support
(using package mathpazo.sty) is provided in psnfss (a required
part of any LaTeX distribution).",应用
texlive-mflogo-font,应用, Metafont logo font," These fonts were created in Metafont by Knuth, for his own
publications. At some stage, the letters 'P' and 'S' were

texlive-microtype,应用, Subliminal refinements towards typographical perfection," The package provides a LaTeX interface to the micro-typographic
extensions that were introduced by pdfTeX and have since also
propagated to XeTeX and LuaTeX: most prominently, character
protrusion and font expansion, furthermore the adjustment of
interword spacing and additional kerning, as well as
hyphenatable letterspacing (tracking) and the possibility to
disable all or selected ligatures. These features may be
applied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro-
typographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a
straight-forward and flexible way. Settings for various fonts
are provided. Note that character protrusion requires pdfTeX,
LuaTeX, or XeTeX. Font expansion works with pdfTeX or LuaTeX.
The package will by default enable protrusion and expansion if
they can safely be assumed to work. Disabling ligatures
requires pdfTeX or LuaTeX, while the adjustment of interword
spacing and of kerning only works with pdfTeX. Letterspacing is
available with pdfTeX or LuaTeX. The alternative package
`letterspace', which also works with plain TeX, provides the
user commands for letterspacing only, omitting support for all
other extensions.",应用
texlive-ms,应用, Various LaTeX packages by Martin Schroder," A bundle of LaTeX packages by Martin Schroder; the collection
comprises: - count1to, make use of fixed TeX counters; -

texlive-passivetex,应用, Support package for XML/SGML typesetting," Packages providing XML parsing, UTF-8 parsing, Unicode
entities, and common formatting object definitions for jadetex.",应用
texlive-pdftex,应用, A TeX extension for direct creation of PDF," An extension of TeX which can be configured to directly
generate PDF documents instead of DVI. All current free TeX
distributionsm including TeX live, MacTeX and MiKTeX include
pdfTeX (Plain TeX) and pdfLaTeX (LaTeX). ConTeXt was designed
around use of pdfTeX (though it is now migrating towards
LuaTeX).",应用
texlive-pgf,应用, Create PostScript and PDF graphics in TeX," PGF is a macro package for creating graphics. It is platform-
and format-independent and works together with the most
important TeX backend drivers, including pdftex and dvips. It
comes with a user-friendly syntax layer called TikZ. Its usage
is similar to pstricks and the standard picture environment.
PGF works with plain (pdf-)TeX, (pdf-)LaTeX, and ConTeXt.
Unlike pstricks, it can produce either PostScript or PDF
output.",应用
texlive-polyglossia,应用, Modern multilingual typesetting with XeLaTeX," This package provides a complete Babel replacement for users of
XeLaTeX; it relies on the fontspec package, version 2.0 at
least. The current release offers support of 68 languages.",应用
texlive-psnfss,应用, Font support for common PostScript fonts," Font definition files, macros and font metrics for freely-
available Adobe Type 1 fonts. The font set consists of the
'LaserWriter 35' set (originally 'freely available' because
embedded in PostScript printers), and a variety of other free
fonts, together with some additions. Note that while many of
the fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers,
most publishers require fonts embedded in documents, which
requires that you have the fonts in your TeX system.
Fortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from URW
(available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts
covered by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica,
New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf
Dingbats. In addition, the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe
Utopia are covered (those fonts were contributed to the Public
Domain by their commercial foundries). Separate packages are
provided to load each font for use as main text font. The
packages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its
size scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as
a Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides
the means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are
tailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics
are covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable
mathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some
glyphs from Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally
extended with the fpl small-caps and old-style figures fonts)
which uses Palatino as base font, with the mathpazo fonts. The
bundle as a whole is part of the LaTeX 'required' set of

texlive-pst-math,应用, Enhancement of PostScript math operators to use with pstricks," PostScript lacks a lot of basic operators such as tan, acos,
asin, cosh, sinh, tanh, acosh, asinh, atanh, exp (with e base).
Also (oddly) cos and sin use arguments in degrees. Pst-math
provides all those operators in a header file pst-math.pro with
wrappers pst-math.sty and pst-math.tex. In addition, sinc,
gauss, gammaln and bessel are implemented (only partially for
the latter). pst-math is designed essentially to work with pst-
plot but can be used in whatever PS code (such as pstricks
SpecialCoor ""!"", which is useful for placing labels). The
package also provides a routine SIMPSON for numerical
integration and a solver of linear equation systems.",应用
texlive-pst-node,应用, Draw connections using pstricks," The package enables the user to connect information, and to
place labels, without knowing (in advance) the actual positions
of the items to be connected, or where the connecting line
should go. The macros are useful for making graphs and trees,
mathematical diagrams, linguistic syntax diagrams, and so on.
The package contents were previously distributed as a part of
the pstricks base distribution.",应用

variety of parameters.",应用
texlive-pst-slpe,应用, Sophisticated colour gradients," This PStricks package covers all the colour gradient
functionality of pst-grad (part of the base pstricks
distribution), and provides the following facilities: - it
permits the user to specify an arbitrary number of colours,
along with the points at which they are to be reached; - it
converts between RGB and HSV behind the scenes; - it provides
concentric and radial gradients; - it provides a command
\psBall that generates bullets with a three-dimensional
appearance; and - uses the xkeyval package for the extended key

texlive-ptext,应用, A 'lipsum' for Persian," The package provides lipsum-like facilities for the Persian
language. The source of the filling text is the Persian epic
""the Shanameh"" (100 paragraphs are used.)",应用
texlive-pxfonts,应用, Palatino-like fonts in support of mathematics," Pxfonts supplies virtual text roman fonts using Adobe Palatino
(or URWPalladioL) with some modified and additional text
symbols in the OT1, T1, and TS1 encodings; maths alphabets
using Palatino/Palladio; maths fonts providing all the symbols
of the Computer Modern and AMS fonts, including all the Greek
capital letters from CMR; and additional maths fonts of various
other symbols. The set is complemented by a sans-serif set of
text fonts, based on Helvetica/NimbusSanL, and a monospace set
derived from the parallel TX font set. All the fonts are in
Type 1 format (AFM and PFB files), and are supported by TeX
metrics (VF and TFM files) and macros for use with LaTeX.",应用
texlive-rsfs,应用, Ralph Smith's Formal Script font," The fonts provide uppercase 'formal' script letters for use as
symbols in scientific and mathematical typesetting (in contrast
to the informal script fonts such as that used for the
'calligraphic' symbols in the TeX maths symbol font). The fonts
are provided as MetaFont source, and as derived Adobe Type 1
format. LaTeX support, for using these fonts in mathematics, is
available via one of the packages calrsfs and mathrsfs.",应用
texlive-scheme-basic,应用, basic scheme (plain and latex)," This is the basic TeX Live scheme: it is a small set of files
sufficient to typeset plain TeX or LaTeX documents in
PostScript or PDF, using the Computer Modern fonts.  This
scheme corresponds to collection-basic and collection-latex.",应用
texlive-tabu,应用, Flexible LaTeX tabulars," The package provides an environment, tabu, which will make any
sort of tabular (that doesn't need to split across pages), and
an environment longtabu which provides the facilities of tabu
in a modified longtable environment. (Note that this latter
offers an enhancement of ltxtable.) The package requires the
array package, and needs e-TeX to run (since array.sty is
present in every conforming distribution of LaTeX, and since
every publicly available LaTeX format is built using e-TeX, the
requirements are provided by default on any reasonable system).
The package also requires xcolor for coloured rules in tables,
and colortbl for coloured cells. The longtabu environment
further requires that longtable be loaded. The package itself
does not load any of these packages for the user. The tabu
environment may be used in place of tabular, tabular* and
tabularx environments, as well as the array environment in
maths mode. It overloads tabularx's X-column specification,
allowing a width specification, alignment (l, r, c and j) and
column type indication (p, m and b). \begin{tabu} to <dimen>
specifies a target width, and \begin{tabu} spread <dimen>
enlarges the environment's ""natural"" width.",应用
texlive-tex4ht,应用, Convert (La)TeX to HTML/XML," A converter from TeX and LaTeX to SGML-based formats such as
(X)HTML, MathML, OpenDocument, and DocBook, providing a
configurable (La)TeX-based authoring system for hypertext.
Tex4ht does not parse (La)TeX source (so that it avoids the
difficulties encountered by many other converters, arising from
the irregularity of (La)TeX syntax). Instead, Tex4ht uses
(La)TeX itself (with an extra macro package) to produce a non-
standard DVI file that it can then process. This technique
allows TeX4ht to approach the robustness characteristic of
restricted-syntax systems such as hyperlatex and gellmu. Note
that CTAN no longer holds the definitive sources of the
package: see the 'Readme' file.",应用

texlive-textcase,应用," Case conversion ignoring mathematics, etc"," The textcase package offers commands \MakeTextUppercase and
\MakeTextLowercase are similar to the standard \MakeUppercase
and \MakeLowercase, but they do not change the case of any
sections of mathematics, or the arguments of \cite, \label and
\ref commands within the argument. A further command
\NoCaseChange does nothing but suppress case change within its
argument, so to force uppercase of a section including an
environment, one might say:
\MakeTextUppercase{...\NoCaseChange{\begin{foo}}
...\NoCaseChange{\end{foo}}...}",应用
texlive-textpos,应用, Place boxes at arbitrary positions on the LaTeX page," A package to facilitate placement of boxes at absolute

might be useful, an important one being to help the creation of
large-format conference posters.",应用
texlive-threeparttable,应用, Tables with captions and notes all the same width," Provides a scheme for tables that have a structured note
section, after the caption. This scheme provides an answer to
the old problem of putting footnotes in tables -- by making
footnotes entirely unnecessary. Note that a threeparttable is
not a float of itself; but you can place it in a table or a
table* environment, if necessary.",应用
texlive-thumbpdf,应用, Thumbnails for pdfTeX and dvips/ps2pdf," A Perl script that provides support for thumbnails in pdfTeX
and dvips/ps2pdf. The script uses ghostscript to generate the
thumbnails which get represented in a TeX readable file that is
read by the package thumbpdf.sty to automatically include the
thumbnails. This arrangement works with both plain TeX and
LaTeX.",应用
texlive-titlesec,应用, Select alternative section titles," A package providing an interface to sectioning commands for
selection from various title styles. E.g., marginal titles and
to change the font of all headings with a single command, also
providing simple one-step page styles. Also includes a package
to change the page styles when there are floats in a page. You
may assign headers/footers to individual floats, too.",应用
texlive-typehtml,应用, Typeset HTML directly from LaTeX," Can handle almost all of HTML2, and most of the math fragment
of the draft HTML3.",应用
texlive-ucs,应用, Extended UTF-8 input encoding support for LaTeX," The bundle provides the ucs package, and utf8x.def, together
with a large number of support files. The utf8x.def definition
file for use with inputenc covers a wider range of Unicode
characters than does utf8.def in the LaTeX distribution. The
package provides facilities for efficient use of its large sets
of Unicode characters. Glyph production may be controlled by
various options, which permits use of non-ASCII characters when
coding mathematical formulae. Note that the bundle previously
had an alias ""unicode""; that alias has now been withdrawn, and
no package of that name now exists.",应用
texlive-ulem,应用, Package for underlining," The package provides an \ul (underline) command which will
break over line ends; this technique may be used to replace \em
(both in that form and as the \emph command), so as to make
output look as if it comes from a typewriter. The package also
offers double and wavy underlining, and striking out (line
through words) and crossing out (/// over words). The package
works with both Plain TeX and LaTeX.",应用
texlive-underscore,应用," Control the behaviour of ""_"" in text"," With the package, \_ in text mode (i.e., \textunderscore)
prints an underscore so that hyphenation of words either side
of it is not affected; a package option controls whether an
actual hyphenation point appears after the underscore, or
merely a break point. The package also arranges that, while in
text, '_' itself behaves as \textunderscore (the behaviour of _
in maths mode is not affected.",应用
texlive-unicode-math,应用, Unicode mathematics support for XeTeX and LuaTeX," The current release of this package typesets mathematics with
unicode input and using OpenType maths fonts. (There is little
compatibility with older maths packages.) XeTeX support is well
tested, though LuaTeX support less so. The package can typeset
using STIX fonts, the XITS development of those fonts, the
Asana-Math fonts, the Latin Modern Math, and the TeX Gyre Math
font familiess, as well as the commercial Cambria Math fonts.
There is no support for extra alphabets in the Unicode 'private
