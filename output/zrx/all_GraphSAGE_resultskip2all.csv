their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more
commonly found in humanist and serif types.

the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

libffi,系统,A portable foreign function interface library ,"Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages. ",系统

sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt. ",应用

Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible.",应用

Federation as well as more common Western, Central European and Cyrillic
blocks making them unique and a very important tool for modern digital
communications.

PT Sans is a grotesque font based on Russian type designs of the second part
of the 20th century. However, it also includes very distinctive features of
modern humanistic design, fulfilling present day aesthetic and functional
requirements.

It was designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov
and released by ParaType.

perl-Class-Method-Modifiers,系统, Provides Moose-like method modifiers," Method modifiers are a powerful feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp Object
System) world.

In its most basic form, a method modifier is just a method that calls
'$self->SUPER::foo(@_)'. I for one have trouble remembering that exact
invocation, so my classes seldom re-dispatch to their base classes. Very
bad!

'Class::Method::Modifiers' provides three modifiers: 'before', 'around',
and 'after'. 'before' and 'after' are run just before and after the method
they modify, but can not really affect that original method. 'around' is
run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call that
original method. See the 'MODIFIERS' section for more details on how the
particular modifiers work.",系统

perl-CPAN-DistnameInfo,系统, Extract distribution name and version from a distribution filename," Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to
associate multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from the
filename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as they
have used ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the
distribution, which results in a uniform name. But sadly not all
uploads are created in this way.

CPAN::DistnameInfo uses heuristics that have been learnt by
http://search.cpan.org/ to extract the distribution name and version

contains Perl code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original
arguments. The string is formatted for easy reading.",系统
perl-Data-OptList,系统, Parse and validate simple name/value option pairs," Hashes are great for storing named data, but if you want more than one entry

to write:

$values = [
    foo => undef,
    bar => undef,
    baz => undef,
    xyz => { ... },
];

With Data::OptList, you can do this instead:

$values = Data::OptList::mkopt([

This works by assuming that any defined scalar is a name and any reference
following a name is its value.",系统

perl-Devel-StackTrace,系统, Perl module implementing stack trace and stack trace frame objects," The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace
and Devel::StackTraceFrame.  The goal of this object is to encapsulate
the information that can found through using the caller() function, as

by the Module::Build project, but may be useful for other purposes as well.",系统
perl-File-chdir,系统, A more sensible way to change directories," Perl's chdir() has the unfortunate problem of being very, very, very
global. If any part of your program calls chdir() or if any library you
use calls chdir(), it changes the current working directory for the
whole program.

This is not good.

File::chdir gives you an alternative, $CWD and @CWD. These two variables
combine all the power of chdir(), File::Spec and Cwd.",系统
perl-File-DesktopEntry,系统, Object to handle .desktop files," This module is used to work with .desktop files. The format of these files

resolution order and method caching in general in Perl 5.9.5 and higher.
This module provides those interfaces for earlier versions of Perl (back
to 5.6.0 anyways).

It is a harmless no-op to use this module on 5.9.5+. That is to say,
code which properly uses MRO::Compat will work unmodified on both older
Perls and 5.9.5+.

It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as IO::All or Path::Class, nor does
it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32 platforms. Even then, it
might break if you try something particularly obscure or tortuous.

All paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes. Stringifying the

perl-Pod-Escapes,系统, Resolve POD escape sequences, This module provides things that are useful in decoding Pod E<...> sequences.,系统
perl-Pod-Plainer,系统, Perl extension for converting Pod to old-style Pod," Pod::Plainer uses Pod::Parser which takes Pod with the (new) 'C<< .. >>'
constructs and returns the old(er) style with just 'C<>'; '<' and '>' are
replaced by 'E<lt>' and 'E<gt>'.
This can be used to pre-process Pod before using tools which do not
recognize the new style Pods.",系统
perl-Scope-Guard,系统, Lexically scoped resource management," This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of
resource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful when
dealing with exceptions: the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to
a subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the thread of
execution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows lexically-scoped
""promises"" to be made that are automatically honored by perl's garbage
collector.",系统
perl-Socket,系统, Networking constants and support functions," This Perl module provides a variety of constants, structure manipulators and
other functions related to socket-based networking. The values and functions

perl-Specio,系统, Type constraints and coercions for Perl," The Specio distribution provides classes for representing type constraints
and coercion, along with syntax sugar for declaring them.

Note that this is not a proper type system for Perl. Nothing in this
distribution will magically make the Perl interpreter start checking a value's
type on assignment to a variable. In fact, there's no built-in way to apply a
type to a variable at all.

Instead, you can explicitly check a value against a type, and optionally coerce
values to that type.",系统

There's another perl module called String::CRC, which supports calculation of
CRC values of various widths (i.e. not just 32 bits), but the generated sums
differ from those of the programs mentioned above.",系统
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive,系统, Only use Sub::Exporter if you need it," Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This module is a
Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your users just use Exporter if all they
are doing is picking exports, but use Sub::Exporter if your users try to use
Sub::Exporter's more advanced features, like renaming exports, if they try to
use them.

Note that this module will export @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK package variables for
Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced Sub::Exporter
features like currying, this module will only ever use Sub::Exporter, so you
might as well use it directly.",系统

imported to be used.",系统
perl-Term-Table,系统, Format a header and rows into a table, This Perl module is able to format rows of data into tables.,系统
perl-Test-Deep,系统, Extremely flexible deep comparison," Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result you
got is the result you were expecting. At its simplest it compares two
structures by going through each level, ensuring that the values
match, that arrays and hashes have the same elements and that
references are blessed into the correct class. It also handles
circular data structures without getting caught in an infinite loop.",系统
perl-Test-LongString,系统, Perl module to test long strings," This module provides some drop-in replacements for the string comparison

perl-Test-Taint,系统, Tools to test taintedness," Tainted data is data that comes from an unsafe source, such as the command
line, or, in the case of web apps, any GET or POST transactions. Read the
perlsec man page for details on why tainted data is bad, and how to untaint
the data.

When you're writing unit tests for code that deals with tainted data, you'll
want to have a way to provide tainted data for your routines to handle, and
easy ways to check and report on the taintedness of your data, in standard
Test::More style.",系统
perl-Test-Warnings,系统, Test for warnings and the lack of them," If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan.",系统

perl-Text-Diff,系统, Perform diffs on files and record sets," Text::Diff provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff utility.
It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is better
integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster
than shelling out to a system's diff executable for small files, and
generally slower on larger files.",系统
perl-Text-ParseWords,系统, Parse text into an array of tokens or array of arrays," The nested_quotewords() and quotewords() functions accept a delimiter (which
can be a regular expression) and a list of lines and then breaks those lines
up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear inside quotes.
quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single long list, while
nested_quotewords() returns a list of token lists corresponding to the
elements of @lines. parse_line() does tokenizing on a single string. The
quotewords() functions simply call &parse_line(), so if you're only splitting
one line you can call parse_line() directly and save a function call.",系统
perl-Text-Unidecode,系统, US-ASCII transliterations of Unicode text," 
Text::Unidecode provides a function, `unidecode(...)' that takes
Unicode data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F). The
representation is almost always an attempt at *transliteration* -- i.e.,
conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
some other writing system.",系统

perl-threads-shared,系统, Perl extension for sharing data structures between threads," By default, variables are private to each thread, and each newly created

perltidy,系统, Tool for indenting and re-formatting Perl scripts," Perltidy is a Perl script that indents and re-formats Perl scripts to
make them easier to read. If you write Perl scripts, or spend much
time reading them, you will probably find it useful. The formatting
can be controlled with command line parameters. The default parameter
settings approximately follow the suggestions in the Perl Style Guide.
Perltidy can also output HTML of both POD and source code. Besides
re-formatting scripts, Perltidy can be a great help in tracking down
errors with missing or extra braces, parentheses, and square brackets
because it is very good at localizing errors.",系统
perl-Types-Serialiser,系统, Simple data types for common serialization formats," This module provides some extra data types that are used by common

of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James
Clark's expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates
a new instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the
document. Expat options may be provided when the XML::Parser object is
created. These options are then passed on to the Expat object on each
parse call. They can also be given as extra arguments to the parse
methods, in which case they override options given at XML::Parser
creation time.",系统

is adapted to run both on Windows and on Unix-alike systems.
The script makes use of Ghostscript for the actual conversion
to PDF. It assumes Ghostscript version 6.51 or later, and (by
default) suppresses its automatic rotation of pages where most
of the text is not horizontal. LaTeX users may make use of the
epstopdf package, which will run the epstopdf script ""on the

texlive-microtype,应用, Subliminal refinements towards typographical perfection," The package provides a LaTeX interface to the micro-typographic
extensions that were introduced by pdfTeX and have since also
propagated to XeTeX and LuaTeX: most prominently, character
protrusion and font expansion, furthermore the adjustment of
interword spacing and additional kerning, as well as
hyphenatable letterspacing (tracking) and the possibility to
disable all or selected ligatures. These features may be
applied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro-
typographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a
straight-forward and flexible way. Settings for various fonts
are provided. Note that character protrusion requires pdfTeX,
LuaTeX, or XeTeX. Font expansion works with pdfTeX or LuaTeX.
The package will by default enable protrusion and expansion if
they can safely be assumed to work. Disabling ligatures
requires pdfTeX or LuaTeX, while the adjustment of interword
