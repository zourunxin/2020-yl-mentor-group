bsf,应用, Bean Scripting Framework," Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write
JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java
class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be
implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.

BSF supports several scripting languages currently:
* Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)
* Python (using either Jython or JPython)
* Tcl (using Jacl)
* NetRexx (an extension of the IBM REXX scripting language in Java)
* XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and
Xerces)

In addition, the following languages are supported with their own BSF
engines:
* Java (using BeanShell, from the BeanShell project)
* JRuby
* JudoScript",应用

JavaScript(tm). You can use BeanShell interactively for Java
experimentation and debugging or as a simple scripting engine for your
applications. In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted Java,
plus some useful stuff. Another way to describe it is to say that in
many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is
embeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications to
execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting
extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you can call your
Java applications and objects from BeanShell; working with Java
objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in Java and
runs in the same space as your application, you can freely pass

results.",应用

libcmocka,应用, Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C," There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

substituted into your program); macro expansion (you can define macros,
and the C preprocessor will replace the macros with their definitions
throughout the program); conditional compilation (using special
preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude parts of the
program according to various conditions); and line control (if you use
a program to combine or rearrange source files into an intermediate
file which is then compiled, you can use line control to inform the
compiler about where each source line originated).

google-guice,应用, Lightweight dependency injection framework for Java 5 and above," Put simply, Guice alleviates the need for factories and the use of new
in your Java code. Think of Guice's @Inject as the new new. You will
still need to write factories in some cases, but your code will not
depend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test
and reuse in other contexts.

Guice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to
features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You
might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core
Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same
features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.

Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a
good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature
with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We
build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather
than adding every feature to the core framework.",应用

binary file.

'hivexregedit' (in perl-hivex) lets you export and merge to the
textual regedit format.

'hivexml' can be used to convert a hive file to a more useful XML
format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says _ukasz.

Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics.",其它

libxcrypt,核心,"Extended crypt library for DES, MD5, Blowfish and others ","libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It

hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt. ",应用

objenesis,应用, A library for instantiating Java objects," Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate

Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways.",应用

In contrast to most existing tools for converting Markdown to HTML, pandoc has
a modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which parse text in a given
format and produce a native representation of the document, and a set of
writers, which convert this native representation into a target format.
Thus, adding an input or output format requires only adding a reader or writer.

Peter the Great from 1708 to 1710, and was realized with financial support
from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.

The fonts include support for all 54 title鹿 languages of the Russian
Federation as well as more common Western, Central European and Cyrillic
blocks making them unique and a very important tool for modern digital
communications.

PT Sans is a grotesque font based on Russian type designs of the second part
of the 20th century. However, it also includes very distinctive features of
modern humanistic design, fulfilling present day aesthetic and functional
requirements.

It was designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov

as it can use. Also, your program will be easier to read, more likely
to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to
send a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one
equation in which you wrote 3.14195.

When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its

UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) and later in
the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment.
Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to provide unique identity
for various software components. Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs
very extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and components
across network-connected systems.

The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in the
Internet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).
It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDs
and supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -

for it at exit.

For perls built with debugging support (-DDEBUGGING), an environment variable

by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very

three font families: Bera Serif (a slab-serif Roman), Bera Sans
(a Frutiger descendant), and Bera Mono (monospaced/typewriter).
Support for use in LaTeX is also provided. The Bera family is a
repackaging, for use with TeX, of the Bitstream Vera family.",应用
texlive-bibtopic,应用, Include multiple bibliographies in a document," The package allows the user to include several bibliographies
covering different 'topics' or bibliographic material into a
document (e.g., one bibliography for primary literature and one
for secondary literature). The package provides commands to
include either all references from a .bib file, only the
references actually cited or those not cited in your document.
The user has to construct a separate .bib file for each
bibliographic 'topic', each of which will be processed
separately by BibTeX. If you want to have bibliographies
specific to one part of a document, see the packages bibunits
or chapterbib.",应用
texlive-bigfoot,应用, Footnotes for critical editions," The package aims to provide a 'one-stop' solution to
requirements for footnotes. It offers: - Multiple footnote
apparatus superior to that of the manyfoot; - Footnotes can be
formatted in separate paragraphs, or be run into a single
paragraph (this choice may be selected per footnote series); -
Things you might have expected (like \verb-like material in
footnotes, and colour selections over page breaks) now work.
Note that the majority of the bigfoot package's interface is
identical to that of manyfoot; users should seek information
from that package's documentation. The bigfoot bundle also
provides the perpage and suffix packages.",应用
texlive-booktabs,应用, Publication quality tables in LaTeX," The package enhances the quality of tables in LaTeX, providing
extra commands as well as behind-the-scenes optimisation.
Guidelines are given as to what constitutes a good table in
this context. From version 1.61, the package offers longtable
compatibility.",应用
texlive-breakurl,应用, Line-breakable \url-like links in hyperref when compiling via dvips/ps2pdf," This package provides a command much like hyperref's \url that
typesets a URL using a typewriter-like font. However, if the
dvips driver is being used, the original \url doesn't allow
line breaks in the middle of the created link: the link comes
in one atomic piece. This package allows such line breaks in
the generated links.",应用
texlive-breqn,应用, Automatic line breaking of displayed equations," The package provides solutions to a number of common
difficulties in writing displayed equations and getting high-
quality output. For example, it is a well-known inconvenience
that if an equation must be broken into more than one line,
'left...right' constructs cannot span lines. The breqn package
makes them work as one would expect whether or not there is an
intervening line break. The single most ambitious goal of the
package, however, is to support automatic linebreaking of
displayed equations. Such linebreaking cannot be done without
substantial changes under the hood in the way formulae are
processed; the code must be watched carefully, keeping an eye
on possible glitches. The bundle also contains the flexisym and
mathstyle packages, which are both designated as support for
breqn.",应用
texlive-caption,应用, Customising captions in floating environments," The caption package provides many ways to customise the
captions in floating environments like figure and table, and
cooperates with many other packages. Facilities include
rotating captions, sideways captions, continued captions (for
tables or figures that come in several parts). A list of
compatibility notes, for other packages, is provided in the
documentation. The package also provides the ""caption outside
float"" facility, in the same way that simpler packages like
capt-of do. The package supersedes caption2.",应用
texlive-changebar,应用, Generate changebars in LaTeX documents," Identify areas of text to be marked with changebars with the
\cbstart and \cbend commands; the bars may be coloured. The
package uses 'drivers' to place the bars; the available drivers
can work with dvitoln03, dvitops, dvips, the emTeX and TeXtures
DVI drivers, and VTeX and PDFTeX.",应用
texlive-cite,应用, Improved citation handling in LaTeX," The package supports compressed, sorted lists of numerical
citations, and also deals with various punctuation and other
issues of representation, including comprehensive management of
break points. The package is compatible with both hyperref and
backref. The package is (unsurprisingly) part of the cite
bundle of the author's citation-related packages.",应用
texlive-classpack,应用, XML mastering for LaTeX classes and packages," The package provides an experiment in using XML (specifically
DocBook 5) to mark up and maintain LaTeX classes and packages.
XSLT 2 styleheets generate the .dtx and .ins distribution files
expected by end users.",应用
texlive-cm,应用, Computer Modern fonts," Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
Modern-style font from Monotype. The family is comprehensive,
offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font,
together with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the
mathematical facilities of TeX itself. The base fonts are
distributed as Metafont source, but autotraced PostScript Type
1 versions are available (one version in the AMS fonts
distribution, and also the BaKoMa distribution). The Computer
Modern fonts have inspired many later families, notably the
European Computer Modern and the Latin Modern families.",应用
texlive-cmap,应用, cmap package, cmap package,应用
texlive-cmextra,应用, cmextra package, cmextra package,应用
texlive-cm-super,应用, CM-Super family of fonts," CM-Super family of fonts are Adobe Type 1 fonts that replace
the T1/TS1-encoded Computer Modern (EC/TC), T1/TS1-encoded
Concrete, T1/TS1-encoded CM bright and LH fonts (thus
supporting all European languages except Greek, and all
Cyrillic-based languages), and bringing many ameliorations in
typesetting quality. The fonts exhibit the same metrics as the
MetaFont-encoded originals.",应用
texlive-cns,应用, cns package, cns package,应用
texlive-collection-basic,应用, Essential programs and files," These files are regarded as basic for any TeX system, covering
plain TeX macros, Computer Modern fonts, and configuration for
common drivers; no LaTeX.",应用

very strongly recommended.",应用
texlive-collection-latexrecommended,应用, LaTeX recommended packages," A collection of recommended add-on packages for LaTeX which
have widespread use.",应用
texlive-collection-xetex,应用, XeTeX packages," Packages for XeTeX, the Unicode/OpenType-enabled TeX by
Jonathan Kew, http://tug.org/xetex.",应用
texlive-csquotes,应用, Context sensitive quotation facilities," This package provides advanced facilities for inline and
display quotations. It is designed for a wide range of tasks
ranging from the most simple applications to the more complex
demands of formal quotations. The facilities include commands,
environments, and user-definable 'smart quotes' which
dynamically adjust to their context. Quotation marks are
switched automatically if quotations are nested and they can be
adjusted to the current language if the babel package is
available. There are additional facilities designed to cope
with the more specific demands of academic writing, especially
in the humanities and the social sciences. All quote styles as
well as the optional active quotes are freely configurable. The
package is dependent on e-TeX, and requires the author's
etoolbox package.",应用
texlive-ctable,应用, Easily typeset centered tables," Provides commands to typeset centered, left- or right-aligned
table and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes. Instead of
an environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the first
is optional and is used for key,value pairs generating
variations on the defaults and offering a route for future
extensions.",应用
texlive-ctablestack,应用, Catcode table stable support," This package provides a method for defining category code table
stacks in LuaTeX. It builds on code provided by the 2015/10/01
release of LaTeX2e (also available as ltluatex.sty for plain
users). It is required by the luatexbase package (v1.0 onward)
which uses ctablestack to provide a back-compatibility form of
this concept.",应用
texlive-datetime,应用, Change format of \today with commands for current time," Provides various different formats for the text created by the
command \today, and also provides commands for displaying the
current time (or any given time), in 12-hour, 24-hour or text
format. The package overrides babel's date format, having its
own library of date formats in different languages. The package
requires the fmtcount package.",应用
texlive-dvipdfmx,应用, An extended version of dvipdfm," Dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) is a development of dvipdfm
created to support multi-byte character encodings and large
character sets for East Asian languages. Dvipdfmx, if ""called""
with the name dvipdfm, operates in a ""dvipdfm compatibility""
mode, so that users of the both packages need only keep one
executable. A secondary design goal is to support as many ""PDF""
features as does pdfTeX. There being no documentation as such,
users are advised to consult the documentation of dvipdfm (as
well, of course, as the package Readme.",应用
texlive-dvipng,应用, A fast DVI to PNG/GIF converter," This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as
obtained from TeX and its relatives. Its benefits include: -
Speed. It offers very fast rendering of DVI as bitmap files,
which makes it suitable for generating large amounts of images
on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and others; -
It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
finishes. There is a --follow switch that makes dvipng wait at
end-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST marker
that indicates the end of the DVI; - Interactive query of
options. dvipng can read options interactively through stdin,
and all options are usable. It is even possible to change the
input file through this interface. - Support for PK, VF,
PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, colour specials, and
inclusion of PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF images.",应用
texlive-dvisvgm,应用, Convert DVI files to Scalable Vector Graphics format (SVG)," Dvisvgm is a command line utility that converts TeX DVI files
to the XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. It
provides full font support including virtual fonts, font maps,
and sub-fonts. If necessary, dvisvgm vectorizes Metafont's
bitmap output in order to always create lossless scalable
output. The embedded SVG fonts can optionally be replaced with
graphics paths so that applications that don't support SVG
fonts are enabled to render the graphics properly. Besides many
other features, dvisvgm also supports color, emTeX, tpic, PDF
mapfile and PostScript specials. Users will need a working TeX
installation including the kpathsea library. For more detailed
information, see the project page.",应用
texlive-ec,应用, Computer modern fonts in T1 and TS1 encodings," The EC fonts are European Computer Modern Fonts, supporting the
complete LaTeX T1 encoding defined at the 1990 TUG conference
hold at Cork/Ireland. These fonts are intended to be stable
with no changes being made to the tfm files. The set also
contains a Text Companion Symbol font, called tc, featuring
many useful characters needed in text typesetting, for example
oldstyle digits, currency symbols (including the newly created
Euro symbol), the permille sign, copyright, trade mark and
servicemark as well as a copyleft sign, and many others. Recent
releases of LaTeX2e support the EC fonts. The EC fonts
supersede the preliminary version released as the DC fonts. The
fonts are available in (traced) Adobe Type 1 format, as part of
the cm-super bundle. The other Computer Modern-style T1-encoded
Type 1 set, Latin Modern, is not actually a direct development
of the EC set, and differs from the EC in a number of
particulars.",应用
texlive-enctex,应用, A TeX extension that translates input on its way into TeX," EncTeX is (another) tex extension, written at the change-file
level. It provides means of translating input on the way into
TeX. It allows, for example, translation of multibyte
sequences, such as utf-8 encoding.",应用
texlive-enumitem,应用," Control layout of itemize, enumerate, description"," This package provides user control over the layout of the three
basic list environments: enumerate, itemize and description. It
supersedes both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well-
structured replacements for all their funtionality), and in
addition provides functions to compute the layout of labels,
and to 'clone' the standard environments, to create new
environments with counters of their own.",应用
texlive-environ,应用, A new interface for environments in LaTeX," The package provides the \collect@body command (as in amsmath),
as well as a \long version \Collect@Body, for collecting the
body text of an environment. These commands are used to define
a new author interface to creating new environments. For
example: \NewEnviron{test} wraps the entire environment body in
square brackets, doing the right thing in ignoring leading and
trailing spaces.",应用
texlive-epsf,应用, Simple macros for EPS inclusion," The original graphics inclusion macros for use with dvips;
still widely used by Plain TeX users (in particular). For LaTeX
users, the package is nowadays deprecated in favour of the more
sophisticated standard LaTeX graphics bundle of packages (which
are also available to Plain TeX users, either via its Plain TeX
version, or through the support offered by etex).",应用
texlive-eso-pic,应用, Add picture commands (or backgrounds) to every page," Eso-pic is an extension of everyshi. Using everyshi's
\EveryShipout command, eso-pic adds one or more user commands
to LaTeX's shipout actions.",应用
texlive-etex,应用," An extended version of TeX, from the NTS project"," An extended version of TeX (which is capable of running as if
it were TeX unmodified). E-TeX has been specified by the LaTeX
team as the engine for the development of LaTeX, in the
immediate future; as a result, LaTeX programmers may (in all
current TeX distributions) assume e-TeX functionality.",应用
texlive-etoolbox,应用, Tool-box for LaTeX programmers using e-TeX," The etoolbox package is a toolbox of programming facilities
geared primarily towards LaTeX class and package authors. It
provides LaTeX frontends to some of the new primitives provided
by e-TeX as well as some generic tools which are not strictly
related to e-TeX but match the profile of this package. Note
that the initial versions of this package were released under
the name elatex. The package provides functions that seem to
offer alternative ways of implementing some LaTeX kernel
commands; nevertheless, the package will not modify any part of
the LaTeX kernel.",应用
texlive-euenc,应用, Unicode font encoding definitions for XeTeX," Font encoding definitions for unicode fonts loaded by LaTeX in
XeTeX or LuaTeX. The package provides two encodings: -- EU1,
designed for use with XeTeX, which the fontspec uses for
unicode fonts which require no macro-level processing for
accents, and -- EU2, which provides the same facilities for use
with LuaTeX. Neither encoding places any restriction on the
glyphs provided by a font; use of EU2 causes the package
euxunicode to be loaded (the package is part of this
distribution). The package includes font definition files for
use with the Latin Modern OpenType fonts.",应用
texlive-euler,应用, Use AMS Euler fonts for math," Provides a setup for using the AMS Euler family of fonts for
mathematics in LaTeX documents. ""The underlying philosophy of
Zapf's Euler design was to capture the flavour of mathematics
as it might be written by a mathematician with excellent
handwriting."" [concrete-tug] The euler package is based on

verbatim macros. You can box mathematics, floats, center,
flushleft, and flushright, lists, and pages.",应用
texlive-fix2col,应用, Fix miscellaneous two column mode features," Fix mark handling so that \firstmark is taken from the first
column if that column has any marks at all; keep two column
floats like figure* in sequence with single column floats like
figure.",应用
texlive-float,应用, Improved interface for floating objects," Improves the interface for defining floating objects such as
figures and tables. Introduces the boxed float, the ruled float
and the plaintop float. You can define your own floats and
improve the behaviour of the old ones. The package also
provides the H float modifier option of the obsolete here
package. You can select this as automatic default with
\floatplacement{figure}{H}.",应用
texlive-fmtcount,应用, Display the value of a LaTeX counter in a variety of formats," The package provides commands that display the value of a LaTeX
counter in a variety of formats (ordinal, text, hexadecimal,
decimal, octal, binary etc). The package offers some
multilingual support; configurations for use in English (both
British and American usage), French (including Belgian and
Swiss variants), German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish
documents are provided. This package was originally provided as
part of the author's datetime package, but is now distributed

specific unicode blocks, for automatic font tagging of
multilingual text. The package uses Perl (via perltex) to
construct its tables.",应用
texlive-fp,应用, Fixed point arithmetic," An extensive collection of arithmetic operations for fixed
point real numbers of high precision.",应用
texlive-fpl,应用, SC and OsF fonts for URW Palladio L," The FPL Fonts provide a set of SC/OsF fonts for URW Palladio L
which are compatible with respect to metrics with the Palatino
SC/OsF fonts from Adobe. Note that it is not my aim to exactly
reproduce the outlines of the original Adobe fonts. The SC and
OsF in the FPL Fonts were designed with the glyphs from URW
Palladio L as starting point. For some glyphs (e.g. 'o') I got
the best result by scaling and boldening. For others (e.g. 'h')
shifting selected portions of the character gave more
satisfying results. All this was done using the free font
editor FontForge. The kerning data in these fonts comes from
Walter Schmidt's improved Palatino metrics. LaTeX use is
enabled by the mathpazo package, which is part of the psnfss
distribution.",应用
texlive-framed,应用, Framed or shaded regions that can break across pages," The package creates three environments: - framed, which puts an
ordinary frame box around the region, - shaded, which shades
the region, and - leftbar, which places a line at the left
side. The environments allow a break at their start (the
\FrameCommand enables creation of a title that is ""attached"" to
the environment); breaks are also allowed in the course of the
framed/shaded matter. There is also a command \MakeFramed to
make your own framed-style environments.",应用
texlive-garuda-c90,应用, TeX support (from CJK) for the garuda font, garuda-c90 package,应用
texlive-geometry,应用, Flexible and complete interface to document dimensions," The package provides an easy and flexible user interface to
customize page layout, implementing auto-centering and auto-
balancing mechanisms so that the users have only to give the
least description for the page layout. For example, if you want
to set each margin 2cm without header space, what you need is
just \usepackage[margin=2cm,nohead]{geometry}. The package
knows about all the standard paper sizes, so that the user need
not know what the nominal 'real' dimensions of the paper are,
just its standard name (such as a4, letter, etc.). An important
feature is the package's ability to communicate the paper size
it's set up to the output (whether via DVI \specials or via
direct interaction with PDF(La)TeX).",应用
texlive-graphics-cfg,应用, Sample configuration files for LaTeX color and graphics," This bundle includes color.cfg and graphics.cfg files that set
default ""driver"" options for the color and graphics packages.
It contains support for defaulting the new LuaTeX option which

implementations for aspects of the LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with
higher-level ideas such as the Designer Interface. Some of them
work as stand alone packages, providing new functionality, and
can be used on top of LaTeX2e with no changes to the existing
kernel. The present release includes: - xgalley, which controls
boxes receiving text for typesetting. - l3dt: kernel support
for data tables; - l3galley: kernel support for xgalley; -
l3regex: kernel support for regular expression search and
replace operations; - l3sort: kernel support for sorting

specified comparison criteria; - l3str: kernel support for
string manipulation; - l3tl-build: kernel support for token
list building; - l3tl_analysis: kernel support for token list
analysis; and - xcoffins, which allows the alignment of boxes
using a series of 'handle' positions, supplementing the simple
TeX reference point. All the files of the bundle are also
available in the Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3
Project.",应用
texlive-lastpage,应用, Reference last page for Page N of M type footers," Reference the number of pages in your LaTeX document through

embedded scripting language. The LuaTeX project's main
objective is to provide an open and configurable variant of TeX
while at the same time offering downward compatibility. LuaTeX
uses Unicode (as UTF-8) as its default input encoding, and is
able to use modern (OpenType) fonts (for both text and
mathematics). It should be noted that LuaTeX is still under
development; its specification has been declared stable, but
absolute stability may not in practice be assumed.",应用

family of text fonts. The Pazo Math family is made up of five
fonts provided in Adobe Type 1 format (PazoMath, PazoMath-
Italic, PazoMath-Bold, PazoMath-BoldItalic, and
PazoMathBlackboardBold). These contain, in designs that match
Palatino, glyphs that are usually not available in Palatino and
for which Computer Modern looks odd when combined with
Palatino. These glyphs include the uppercase Greek alphabet in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, the
lowercase Greek alphabet in slanted shape in regular and bold
weights, several mathematical glyphs (partialdiff, summation,
product, coproduct, emptyset, infinity, and proportional) in
regular and bold weights, other glyphs (Euro and dotlessj) in
upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, and the
uppercase letters commonly used to represent various number
sets (C, I, N, Q, R, and Z) in blackboard bold. The set also
includes a set of 'true' small-caps fonts, also suitable for
use with Palatino (or one of its clones). LaTeX macro support
(using package mathpazo.sty) is provided in psnfss (a required
part of any LaTeX distribution).",应用

fiction, and mathematical works. Permissible document 'base'
font sizes range from 9 to 60pt. There is a range of page-
styles and well over a dozen chapter-styles to choose from, as
well as methods for specifying your own layouts and designs.
The class also provides the functionality of over thirty of the
more popular packages, thus simplifying document sources. The
class automatically loads an associated patch file mempatch;
the patch file may be updated from time to time, between
releases of the class itself. (The patch file stays around even
when there are no extant patches.) Users who wish to use the
hyperref package, in a document written with the memoir class,
should also use the memhfixc package (part of this bundle).
Note, however, that current versions of hyperref actually load
the package automatically if they detect that they are running
under memoir.",应用
texlive-metafont,应用, A system for specifying fonts," The program takes a semi-algorithmic specification of a font,
and produces a bitmap font (whose properties are defined by a
set of parameters of the target device), and a set metrics for
use by TeX. The bitmap output may be converted into a format
directly usable by a device driver, etc., by the tools provided
in the parallel mfware distribution. (Third parties have
developed tools to convert the bitmap output to outline fonts.)
The distribution includes the source of Knuth's Metafont book;
this source is there to read, as an example of writing TeX --
it should not be processed without Knuth's direct permission.",应用
texlive-metapost,应用, A development of Metafont for creating graphics," MetaPost uses a language based on that of Metafont to produce
precise technical illustrations. Its output is scalable
PostScript or SVG, rather than the bitmaps Metafont creates.",应用
texlive-mfnfss,应用, Packages to typeset oldgerman and pandora fonts in LaTeX," This bundle contains two packages: - oldgerm, a package to
typeset with old german fonts designed by Yannis Haralambous. -
pandora, a package to typeset with Pandora fonts designed by
Neena Billawala. Note that support for the Pandora fonts is
also available via the pandora-latex package.",应用
texlive-microtype,应用, Subliminal refinements towards typographical perfection," The package provides a LaTeX interface to the micro-typographic
extensions that were introduced by pdfTeX and have since also
propagated to XeTeX and LuaTeX: most prominently, character
protrusion and font expansion, furthermore the adjustment of
interword spacing and additional kerning, as well as
hyphenatable letterspacing (tracking) and the possibility to
disable all or selected ligatures. These features may be
applied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro-
typographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a
straight-forward and flexible way. Settings for various fonts
are provided. Note that character protrusion requires pdfTeX,
LuaTeX, or XeTeX. Font expansion works with pdfTeX or LuaTeX.
The package will by default enable protrusion and expansion if
they can safely be assumed to work. Disabling ligatures
requires pdfTeX or LuaTeX, while the adjustment of interword
spacing and of kerning only works with pdfTeX. Letterspacing is
available with pdfTeX or LuaTeX. The alternative package
`letterspace', which also works with plain TeX, provides the
user commands for letterspacing only, omitting support for all
other extensions.",应用
texlive-mptopdf,应用," mpost to PDF, native MetaPost graphics inclusion"," The mptopdf script does standalone conversion from mpost to
PDF, using the supp-* and syst-* files.  They also allow native
MetaPost graphics inclusion in LaTeX (via pdftex.def) and
ConTeXt.  They can be used independently of the rest of
ConTeXt, yet are maintained as part of it.  So in TeX Live we
pull them out to this separate package for the benefit of LaTeX
users who do not install the rest of ConTeXt.  This can be
found on CTAN in macros/pdftex/graphics.",应用
texlive-multirow,应用, Create tabular cells spanning multiple rows," The package has a lot of flexibility, including an option for
specifying an entry at the ""natural"" width of its text. The
package is distributed with the bigdelim and bigstrut packages,
which can be used to advantage with \multirow cells.",应用
texlive-natbib,应用, Flexible bibliography support," Provides a style with author-year and numbered references, as
well as much detailed of support for other bibliography use.

texlive-paralist,应用, Enumerate and itemize within paragraphs," Provides enumerate and itemize environments that can be used
within paragraphs to format the items either as running text or
as separate paragraphs with a preceding number or symbol. Also
provides compacted versions of enumerate and itemize.",应用
texlive-parskip,应用," Layout with zero \parindent, non-zero \parskip"," Simply changing \parskip and \parindent leaves a layout that is
untidy; this package (though it is no substitute for a
properly-designed class) helps alleviate this untidiness",应用
texlive-passivetex,应用, Support package for XML/SGML typesetting," Packages providing XML parsing, UTF-8 parsing, Unicode
entities, and common formatting object definitions for jadetex.",应用
texlive-pdfpages,应用, Include PDF documents in LaTeX," This package simplifies the inclusion of external multi-page
PDF documents in LaTeX documents. Pages may be freely selected
and similar to psnup it is possible to put several logical
pages onto each sheet of paper. Furthermore a lot of hypertext
features like hyperlinks and article threads are provided. The
package supports pdfTeX (pdflatex) and VTeX. With VTeX it is
even possible to use this package to insert PostScript files,
in addition to PDF files.",应用
texlive-philokalia,应用, A font to typeset the Philokalia Books," The philokalia package has been designed to ease the use of the
Philokalia-Regular OpenType font with XeLaTeX. The font started
as a project to digitize the typeface used to typeset the

texlive-plain,应用, plain package," Contains files used to build the Plain TeX format, as described
in the TeXbook, together with various supporting files (some
also discussed in the book).",应用
texlive-polyglossia,应用, Modern multilingual typesetting with XeLaTeX," This package provides a complete Babel replacement for users of
XeLaTeX; it relies on the fontspec package, version 2.0 at
least. The current release offers support of 68 languages.",应用
texlive-pslatex,应用, Use PostScript fonts by default," A small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard'
PostScript fonts. It is basically a merger of the times and the
(obsolete) mathptm packages from the psnfss suite. You must
have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts
to use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex
package tries to compensate for the visual differences between
the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing'
Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is
supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that
allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without
needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a
different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available
now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,
pslatex is widely considered obsolete.",应用
texlive-pspicture,应用, PostScript picture support," A replacement for LaTeX's picture macros, that uses PostScript
\special commands. The package is now largely superseded by
pict2e.",应用
texlive-pst-blur,应用," PSTricks package for ""blurred"" shadows"," Pst-blur is a package built for use with PSTricks. It provides

gradients. Supported are colours in the RGB, CMYK or HSB
models. Other colour gradient mechanisms are to be found in
package pst-slpe.",应用
texlive-pst-node,应用, Draw connections using pstricks," The package enables the user to connect information, and to
place labels, without knowing (in advance) the actual positions
of the items to be connected, or where the connecting line
should go. The macros are useful for making graphs and trees,
mathematical diagrams, linguistic syntax diagrams, and so on.
The package contents were previously distributed as a part of
the pstricks base distribution.",应用
texlive-pst-plot,应用, Plot data using PSTricks," The package provides plotting of data (typically from external
files), using PSTricks. Plots my be configured using a wide
variety of parameters.",应用
texlive-pst-slpe,应用, Sophisticated colour gradients," This PStricks package covers all the colour gradient
functionality of pst-grad (part of the base pstricks
distribution), and provides the following facilities: - it
permits the user to specify an arbitrary number of colours,
along with the points at which they are to be reached; - it
converts between RGB and HSV behind the scenes; - it provides
concentric and radial gradients; - it provides a command
\psBall that generates bullets with a three-dimensional
appearance; and - uses the xkeyval package for the extended key
handling.",应用
texlive-ptext,应用, A 'lipsum' for Persian," The package provides lipsum-like facilities for the Persian
language. The source of the filling text is the Persian epic
""the Shanameh"" (100 paragraphs are used.)",应用
texlive-qstest,应用, Bundle for unit tests and pattern matching," This is the public release of the qstest bundle (written for
DocScape Publisher) (C) 2006, 2007 QuinScape GmbH. The bundle
contains the packages 'makematch' for matching patterns to
targets (with a generalization in the form of pattern lists and
keyword lists), and 'qstest' for performing unit tests,
allowing the user to run a number of logged tests ensuring the
consistency of values, properties and call sequences during
execution of test code. Both packages make extensive use of in
their package documentation, providing illustrated examples
that are automatically verified to work as expected. Check the
README file for details.",应用
texlive-rsfs,应用, Ralph Smith's Formal Script font," The fonts provide uppercase 'formal' script letters for use as
symbols in scientific and mathematical typesetting (in contrast
to the informal script fonts such as that used for the
'calligraphic' symbols in the TeX maths symbol font). The fonts
are provided as MetaFont source, and as derived Adobe Type 1
format. LaTeX support, for using these fonts in mathematics, is
available via one of the packages calrsfs and mathrsfs.",应用
texlive-sansmath,应用, Maths in a sans font," The package defines a new math version sans, and a command
\sansmath that behaves somewhat like \boldmath",应用
texlive-sauerj,应用, A bundle of utilities by Jonathan Sauer," The bundle consists of: a tool for collecting text for later
re-use, a tool for typesetting the ""meta-information"" within a
text, a tool for use in constructing macros with multiple
optional parameters, a package for multiple column parallel
texts, a tool for processing key-value structured lists, and
macros for typesetting a number as a German-language string.",应用
texlive-section,应用, Modifying section commands in LaTeX," The package implements a pretty extensive scheme to make more
manageable the business of configuring LaTeX output.",应用
texlive-seminar,应用, Make overhead slides," A class that produces overhead slides (transparencies), with
many facilities. The class requires availability of the
fancybox package. Seminar is also the basis of other classes,
such as prosper. In fact, seminar is not nowadays reckoned a
good basis for a presentation -- users are advised to use more
recent classes such as powerdot or beamer, both of which are
tuned to 21st-century presentation styles. Note that the
seminar distribution relies on the xcomment package, which was
once part of the bundle, but now has a separate existence.",应用
texlive-showexpl,应用, Typesetting LaTeX source code," This package provides a way to typeset LaTeX source code and
the related result in the same document.",应用
texlive-subfig,应用, Figures broken into subfigures," The package provides support for the manipulation and reference
of small or 'sub' figures and tables within a single figure or
table environment. It is convenient to use this package when
your subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or
are to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \subfigure
command is introduced which can be used inside a figure
environment for each subfigure. An optional first argument is
used as the caption for that subfigure. This package supersedes
the subfigure package (which will continue to be supported, but
no longer maintained). The name has changed because the subfig
package is not completely backward compatible with the older
subfigure package due to an extensive rewrite to use the new
caption package to produce its subcaptions. The major advantage
to the new package is that the user interface is keyword/value
driven and easier to use. To ease the transition from the
subfigure package it includes a configuration file (subfig.cfg)
which nearly emulates the subfigure package.",应用
texlive-svn-prov,应用, Subversion variants of \Provides... macros," The package introduces Subversion variants of the standard
LaTeX macros \ProvidesPackage, \ProvidesClass and \ProvidesFile
where the file name and date is extracted from Subversion Id
keywords. The file name may also be given explicitly as an
optional argument.",应用
texlive-tabu,应用, Flexible LaTeX tabulars," The package provides an environment, tabu, which will make any
sort of tabular (that doesn't need to split across pages), and
an environment longtabu which provides the facilities of tabu
in a modified longtable environment. (Note that this latter
offers an enhancement of ltxtable.) The package requires the
array package, and needs e-TeX to run (since array.sty is
present in every conforming distribution of LaTeX, and since
every publicly available LaTeX format is built using e-TeX, the
requirements are provided by default on any reasonable system).
The package also requires xcolor for coloured rules in tables,
and colortbl for coloured cells. The longtabu environment
further requires that longtable be loaded. The package itself
does not load any of these packages for the user. The tabu
environment may be used in place of tabular, tabular* and
tabularx environments, as well as the array environment in
maths mode. It overloads tabularx's X-column specification,
allowing a width specification, alignment (l, r, c and j) and
column type indication (p, m and b). \begin{tabu} to <dimen>
specifies a target width, and \begin{tabu} spread <dimen>
enlarges the environment's ""natural"" width.",应用
texlive-tex,应用, A sophisticated typesetting engine," TeX is a typesetting system that incorporates a macro
processor. A TeX source document specifies or incorporates a
number of macro definitions that instruct the TeX engine how to
typeset the document. The TeX engine also uses font metrics
generated by Metafont, or by any of several other mechanisms
that incorporate fonts from other sources into an environment
suitable for TeX. TeX has been, and continues, a basis and an
inspiration for several other programs, including e-TeX and
PDFTeX. The distribution includes the source of Knuth's TeX
book; this source is there to read, as an example of writing
TeX -- it should not be processed without Knuth's direct
permission.",应用
texlive-tex-ini-files,应用, Model TeX format creation files," This bundle provides a collection of model .ini files for
creating TeX formats. These files are commonly used to
introduced distribution-dependent variations in formats. They
are also used to allow existing format source files to be used
with newer engines, for example to adapt the plain e-TeX source
file to work with XeTeX and LuaTeX.",应用
texlive-texlive-docindex,应用," top-level TeX Live doc.html, etc"," These files are regenerated as needed, which is often, so we
make them a separate package.  See the tl-update-auto script

texlive-texlive-en,应用, TeX Live manual (English), texlive-en package,应用
texlive-texlive-msg-translations,应用, translations of the TeX Live installer and TeX Live Manager," This package contains the translated messages of the TeX Live
installer and TeX Live Manager.  For information on creating or
updating translations, see
http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html#install-tl-xlate.",应用
texlive-textcase,应用," Case conversion ignoring mathematics, etc"," The textcase package offers commands \MakeTextUppercase and
\MakeTextLowercase are similar to the standard \MakeUppercase
and \MakeLowercase, but they do not change the case of any
sections of mathematics, or the arguments of \cite, \label and
\ref commands within the argument. A further command
\NoCaseChange does nothing but suppress case change within its
argument, so to force uppercase of a section including an
environment, one might say:
\MakeTextUppercase{...\NoCaseChange{\begin{foo}}
...\NoCaseChange{\end{foo}}...}",应用
texlive-textpos,应用, Place boxes at arbitrary positions on the LaTeX page," A package to facilitate placement of boxes at absolute
positions on the LaTeX page. There are several reasons why this
might be useful, an important one being to help the creation of
large-format conference posters.",应用
texlive-times,应用," URW ""Base 35"" font pack for LaTeX"," A set of fonts for use as ""drop-in"" replacements for Adobe's

texlive-txfonts,应用, Times-like fonts in support of mathematics," Txfonts supplies virtual text roman fonts using Adobe Times (or
URW NimbusRomNo9L) with some modified and additional text
symbols in the OT1, T1, and TS1 encodings; maths alphabets
using Times/URW Nimbus; maths fonts providing all the symbols
of the Computer Modern and AMS fonts, including all the Greek
capital letters from CMR; and additional maths fonts of various
other symbols. The set is complemented by a sans-serif set of
text fonts, based on Helvetica/NimbusSanL, and a monospace set.
All the fonts are in Type 1 format (AFM and PFB files), and are
supported by TeX metrics (VF and TFM files) and macros for use
with LaTeX.",应用
texlive-type1cm,应用, Arbitrary size font selection in LaTeX," LaTeX, by default, restricts the sizes at which you can use its
default computer modern fonts, to a fixed set of discrete sizes
(effectively, a set specified by Knuth). The type1cm package
removes this restriction; this is particularly useful when
using scalable versions of the cm fonts (Bakoma, or the
versions from BSR/Y&Y, or True Type versions from Kinch, PCTeX,
etc.). In fact, since modern distributions will automatically
generate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider
application than just those using scaleable versions of the
fonts. Note that the LaTeX distribution now contains a package
fix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing
the same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts.",应用
texlive-ucharclasses,应用, Switch fonts in XeTeX according to what is being processed," The package takes care of switching fonts when you switch from
one Unicode block to another in the text of a document. This
way, you can write a document with no explicit font selection,
but a series of rules of the form ""when entering block ...,
switch font to use ..."".",应用
texlive-ucs,应用, Extended UTF-8 input encoding support for LaTeX," The bundle provides the ucs package, and utf8x.def, together
with a large number of support files. The utf8x.def definition
file for use with inputenc covers a wider range of Unicode
characters than does utf8.def in the LaTeX distribution. The
package provides facilities for efficient use of its large sets
of Unicode characters. Glyph production may be controlled by
various options, which permits use of non-ASCII characters when
coding mathematical formulae. Note that the bundle previously
had an alias ""unicode""; that alias has now been withdrawn, and
no package of that name now exists.",应用
texlive-utopia,应用, Adobe Utopia fonts," The Adobe Standard Encoding set (upright and italic shapes,
medium and bold weights) of the Utopia font family, which Adobe
donated to the X Consortium. Macro support, and maths fonts
that match the Utopia family, are provided by the Fourier and
the Mathdesign Utopia font packages.",应用
texlive-wadalab,应用, Wadalab (Japanese) font packages," These are font bundles for the Japanese Wadalab fonts which

texlive-xcolor,应用, Driver-independent color extensions for LaTeX and pdfLaTeX," Provides easy driver-independent access to several kinds of
color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colors. It
allows a user to select a document-wide target color model and
offers complete tools for conversion between eight color
models. Additionally, there is a command for alternating row
colors plus repeated non-aligned material (like horizontal
lines) in tables. Colors can be mixed like
\color{red!30!green!40!blue}.",应用
texlive-xdvi,应用, A DVI previewer for the X Window System," The canonical previewer for use on Unix and other X-windows
based systems. The distribution has been integrated with that
of xdvik (no longer separately available), so that it will
build with web2c ""out of the box"". In practice, it is usually
distributed via Tex-live.",应用
texlive-xecjk,应用, Support for CJK documents in XeLaTeX," A LaTeX package for typesetting CJK documents in the way users
have become used to, in the CJK package. The package requires a
current version of xtemplate (and hence of the current LaTeX 3
development environment.",应用
texlive-xeindex,应用, Automatic index generation for XeLaTeX," The package is based on XeSearch, and will automatically index
words or phrases in an XeLaTeX document. Words are declared in
a list, and every occurrence then creates an index entry whose
content can be fully specified beforehand.",应用
texlive-xetex,应用, Unicode and OpenType-enabled TeX engine," XeTeX is an extension of TeX that integrates TeX's typesetting capabilities
with (a) the Unicode text encoding standard (supporting most of the world__
scripts) and (b) modern font technologies (TrueType and OpenType) and text
layout services (AAT, OpenType layout, SIL Graphite) provided by the host
operating system and available libraries.

With XeTeX, the advanced typographic features provided by OpenType fonts become
available for all TeX users, as well as support for complex non-roman scripts.
XeTeX also eliminates the complex task of managing a TeX font installation.
XeTeX is now part of the standard TeX distribution TeXLive and works well with
TeX macro packages like LaTeX and ConTeXt.",应用
texlive-xetex-tibetan,应用, XeTeX input maps for Unicode Tibetan," The package provides a map for use with Jonathan Kew's TECkit,
to translate Tibetan to Unicode (range 0F00-0FFF).",应用
texlive-xifthen,应用, Extended conditional commands," This package extends the ifthen package by implementing new
commands to go within the first argument of \ifthenelse: to
test whether a string is void or not, if a command is defined
or equivalent to another. The package also enables use of
complex expressions as introduced by the package calc, together
with the ability of defining new commands to handle complex
tests. The package requires e-TeX features.",应用
texlive-xmltex,应用, Support for parsing XML documents," This package provides an implementation of a parser for
documents matching the XML 1.0 and XML Namespace
Recommendations. In addition to parsing commands are provided

Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation
used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial
difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:
* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or
* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required
