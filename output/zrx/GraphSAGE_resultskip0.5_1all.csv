alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
storage medium.	 It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are ""endian safe"" and can
thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
and also between IRIX machines.

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups. "
xz,核心,应用,LZMA compression utilities ,"XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in
freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing tools and libraries
which are similar to use than the equivalents of the most popular existing
compression algorithms.

LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor Pavlov as
part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while keeping the
decompression speed fast. "
xz-libs,核心,应用, Libraries for decoding LZMA compression, Libraries for decoding files compressed with LZMA or XZ utils.
xz-lzma-compat,核心,应用, Older LZMA format compatibility binaries," The lzma-compat package contains compatibility links for older
commands that deal with the older LZMA format."
zip,应用,系统,A file compression and packaging utility compatible with PKZIP ,"The zip program is a compression and file packaging utility.  Zip is
analogous to a combination of the UNIX tar and compress commands and
is compatible with PKZIP (a compression and file packaging utility for
MS-DOS systems).

Install the zip package if you need to compress files using the zip
program. "
zlib,核心,应用, The compression and decompression library," Zlib is a general-purpose, patent-free, lossless data compression
library which is used by many different programs."
zsh,系统,应用,Powerful interactive shell ,"The zsh shell is a command interpreter usable as an interactive login
shell and as a shell script command processor.  Zsh resembles the ksh
shell (the Korn shell), but includes many enhancements.  Zsh supports
command line editing, built-in spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and more. "
zsh-html,系统,应用, Zsh shell manual in html format," The zsh shell is a command interpreter usable as an interactive login
shell and as a shell script command processor.  Zsh resembles the ksh
shell (the Korn shell), but includes many enhancements.  Zsh supports
command line editing, built-in spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and more.

This package contains the Zsh manual in html format."
zssh,应用,系统, SSH and Telnet client with ZMODEM file transfer capability, SSH and Telnet client with ZMODEM file transfer capability.
zstd,系统,应用, Zstd compression library," Zstd, short for Zstandard, is a fast lossless compression algorithm,
targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level compression ratio."
