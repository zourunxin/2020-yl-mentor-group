libcmocka,应用,系统, Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C," There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

This is the successor of Google's Cmockery."

dwarves,应用,系统, Debugging Information Manipulation Tools (pahole & friends)," dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in

GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results."

If nothing is printed and the script exits with code 0 (no error),
then it can mean either that the program is running on bare-metal or
the program is running inside a type of virtual machine which we don't
know about or can't detect.

xfsdump,系统,应用,Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem ,"The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
other utilities for administering XFS filesystems.

xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
storage medium.	 It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are ""endian safe"" and can
thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
and also between IRIX machines.

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups. "

network. An NIS server is provided in the ypserv package.

Install the yp-tools package if you need NIS client programs for machines
on your network.  You will also need to install the ypbind package on
every machine running NIS client programs.  If you need an NIS server,
you'll need to install the ypserv package on one machine on the network."
