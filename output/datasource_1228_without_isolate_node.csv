",Manipulate netfilter connection tracking table and run High Availability ,"With conntrack-tools you can setup a High Availability cluster and
synchronize conntrack state between multiple firewalls.

The conntrack-tools package contains two programs:
- conntrack: the command line interface to interact with the connection
             tracking system.
- conntrackd: the connection tracking userspace daemon that can be used to
              deploy highly available GNU/Linux firewalls and collect
              statistics of the firewall use.

conntrack is used to search, list, inspect and maintain the netfilter
connection tracking subsystem of the Linux kernel.
Using conntrack, you can dump a list of all (or a filtered selection  of)
currently tracked connections, delete connections from the state table,
and even add new ones.
In addition, you can also monitor connection tracking events, e.g.
show an event message (one line) per newly established connection. "

is known more commonly as pthreads. A good number of modern operating
systems include a threading library of some kind: Solaris (UI)

sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

You can use Redis from most programming languages also."

remaining coverage is available from the MinionPro font with
the MinionPro package. The fonts are available in both MetaFont
and Adobe Type 1 formats, and a comprehensive support package
is provided. While the fonts were designed to fit with Minon
Pro, the design should fit well with other renaissance or
baroque faces: indeed, it will probably work with most fonts
that are neither too wide nor too thin, for example Palatino or
Times; it is known to look good with Sabon. There is no package

This package's NIS implementation is based on FreeBSD's YP and is a
special port for glibc 2.x and libc versions 5.4.21 and later.  This
package only provides the NIS client programs.  In order to use the
clients, you'll need to already have an NIS server running on your
network. An NIS server is provided in the ypserv package.

Install the yp-tools package if you need NIS client programs for machines
on your network.  You will also need to install the ypbind package on
every machine running NIS client programs.  If you need an NIS server,
you'll need to install the ypserv package on one machine on the network."

zimg,应用," Scaling, color space conversion, and dithering library  The ""z"" library implements the commonly required image processing basics of scaling, color space conversion, and depth conversion. A simple API enables conversion between any supported formats to operate with minimal knowledge from the programmer. All library routines were designed from the ground-up with correctness, flexibility, and thread-safety as first priorities. Allocation, buffering, and I/O are cleanly separated from processing, allowing the programmer to adapt ""z"" to many scenarios."," Scaling, color space conversion, and dithering library"," The ""z"" library implements the commonly required image processing basics of

The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals, closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time period."," Raw VBI, Teletext and Closed Caption decoding library"," ZVBI provides functions to capture and decode VBI data.
