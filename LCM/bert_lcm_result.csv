perl-Eval-Closure,库,库, Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval," String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses
it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which
speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without
its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly)."

written to within the configured time period, the watchdog timer expiration
will trigger a machine reboot. When operating as a software watchdog, the
ability to reboot will depend on the state of the machine and interrupts.
When operating as a hardware watchdog, the machine will experience a hard
reset (or whatever action was configured to be taken upon watchdog timer
expiration) initiated by the BMC. "

inclusion of header files (files of declarations that can be
substituted into your program); macro expansion (you can define macros,
and the C preprocessor will replace the macros with their definitions
throughout the program); conditional compilation (using special
preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude parts of the
program according to various conditions); and line control (if you use
a program to combine or rearrange source files into an intermediate
file which is then compiled, you can use line control to inform the
compiler about where each source line originated).

You should install this package if you are a C programmer and you use
macros."

the KRA which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can only
be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.

transformed by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to
a file again. An even more interesting application is the creation of
classes from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library
(BCEL) may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual

decompressed by the same decompressor instance."
