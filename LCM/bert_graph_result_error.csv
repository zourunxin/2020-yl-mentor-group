processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations remains

providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to
support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of
the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in
fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but
rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference
implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates the desired level of
scalability."
