the KRA which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can only
be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.

Note that the KRA archives encryption keys; it does NOT archive signing keys,
since such archival would undermine non-repudiation properties of signing keys."
