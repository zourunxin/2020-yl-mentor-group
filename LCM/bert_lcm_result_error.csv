an existing Windows VM.

libraries. However, SIP can be used to generate Python bindings for any C++
class library."

   rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets
then ipset may be the proper tool for you."

munge-maven-plugin,库,工具, Munge Maven Plugin," Munge is a purposely-simple Java preprocessor. It only supports
conditional inclusion of source based on defined strings of the
form ""if[tag]"", ""if_not[tag]"", ""else[tag]"", and ""end[tag]"".
Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible."

the certificate enrollment process.  The key archival mechanism is triggered
when a user enrolls in the PKI and creates the certificate request.  Using the
Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request format, a request is
generated for the user's private encryption key.  This key is then stored in
the KRA which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can only
be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.

Note that the KRA archives encryption keys; it does NOT archive signing keys,
since such archival would undermine non-repudiation properties of signing keys."

pmix,库,工具, Process Management Interface Exascale (PMIx)," The Process Management Interface (PMI) has been used for quite some time as
a means of exchanging wireup information needed for interprocess
communication. Two versions (PMI-1 and PMI-2) have been released as part of
the MPICH effort. While PMI-2 demonstrates better scaling properties than its
PMI-1 predecessor, attaining rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M
processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations remains
challenging.

PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by
providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to
support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of
the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in
fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but
rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference
implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates the desired level of
scalability."
