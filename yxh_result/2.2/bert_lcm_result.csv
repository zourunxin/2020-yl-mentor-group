while under test.

you to create a hosts file to setup name resolution for the addresses you use
with socket_wrapper.

To use it set the following environment variables:

perl-Eval-Closure,库,库, Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval," String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses
it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which
speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without
its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly)."

be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.

perl-Test-Warnings,库,库, Test for warnings and the lack of them," If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan."

transformed by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to
a file again. An even more interesting application is the creation of
classes from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library
(BCEL) may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class files.  BCEL is already

libffi,库,库,A portable foreign function interface library ,"Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages. "

apache-commons-collections,库,库," Provides new interfaces, implementations and utilities for Java Collections"," The introduction of the Collections API by Sun in JDK 1.2 has been a
boon to quick and effective Java programming. Ready access to powerful
data structures has accelerated development by reducing the need for
custom container classes around each core object. Most Java2 APIs are
significantly easier to use because of the Collections API.
However, there are certain holes left unfilled by Sun's
implementations, and the Jakarta-Commons Collections Component strives
to fulfill them. Among the features of this package are:
- special-purpose implementations of Lists and Maps for fast access
- adapter classes from Java1-style containers (arrays, enumerations) to
Java2-style collections.
- methods to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections
such as union, intersection, and closure."
